('Info About Text', '<p>Troy has a lot of potential. It is the second fastest
growing city in the Capital District area of New York State ("City Receives").
If you contact the mayor\'s office in this picturesque town on the Hudson River,
you will probably get a decent sized list of prospective investors and
developers. With the local government of cities all over the United States
typically focused on offering incentives to draw "big business," who is looking
out for the "little man?"</p>
<p>When it comes to prices and convenience, at first glance, local businesses,
or, "Small-Marts" are seemingly at a disadvantage compared to mega-chain stores
such as "Walmart." However, if you take into account the socio-economic
footprint of such megastores you find that consumers are subsidizing big
business (Shuman 5). It also makes sense that local businesses tend to invest
more money and human capital locally. So a consumer might find that an extra few
dollars spent locally, in the final analysis, actually saves them money.</p>
<p>It will definitely save them peace of mind, since it is well known that the
carbon footprint of a product bought from a large "fulfillment" business like
Walmart, or, Safeway, is much larger (due to a top-down structure of
organization that makes shipping goods across country a regular occurrence),
than the same one bought from your corner grocer.</p>
<p>With knowledge about the conveniently walkable distances of local businesses,
more Troy residents may be encouraged to live healthier, less polluting
lifestyles while saving money on gas and promoting a greater sense of community.
As middle-class consumers become more aware about how their purchasing decisions
affect their local community, there is a greater need for tools that will make
buying local easier (Shuman 105-109). With the success of such websites as
Amazon.com redefining the shopping experience, it is arguable that online
shopping focused on local purchasing options may be a viable way of helping to
sustain the community. Buy Local has been developed in Drupal and aims to be
this new online shopping experience. What makes this invention so exciting is
that it is a mesh-work. It combines the socio-economics of sustainable local
shopping with the tools of the internet. Using ideas that savvy internet surfers
are already familiar with: user reviews, searchable inventory, map directions,
etc., it offers them an opportunity to find a specific product down the street.
This service is different from online yellow pages because the inventory is more
specific, and can be purchased with a click of a button. It is also different
from traditional Web Services, because it is not for one specific vendor, but
for all local vendors. Finally, it is being distributed as freeware and is
uniquely positioned to help build "flexible specialization" into local economies
by encouraging competitive "craft production" (Piore & Sabel).</p>
<p>In conclusion, a new online shopping experience, "Buy Local" is offered that
encourages sustainable local development by giving consumers access to a
streamlined tool for buying locally.</p>

('Info Project Text', '<p>The Buy Local Open Source Rensselaer (BLOSR) project
was started in Troy NY by Professor Ron Eglash (Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute), and graduate student Logan Williams (Rensselear). The project is
funded by the <a href="http://rcos.cs.rpi.edu/">Renssealer Center for Open
Source</a>.</p>
<h2>2008</h2>
<p>Kyle Balogh (University of Colorado at Boulder) created most of the Drupal
installation profile based on their vision. Vincent Vainius (Rensselear) worked
on initial brainstorming and created the Buy Local logo. The project was hosted
initially by www.hostgrown.com. Susan Remondi (Rensselear), Scott Sibberson
(Rensselear) and Grace DiCinit (Rensselaer) moved it from hostgrown to rpi.edu.
</p>
<h2>2009</h2>
<p>The decision was made to move away from Drupal towards a platform that
allowed students to design the website for administration by a user who is
completely unfamiliar with computer programming. Mike Pennisi (Rensselear)
worked on initial brainstorming and created the new Buy Local logo and website
layout. Aaron Ryden (Rensselaer) and Mike are working on developing the new site
in PHP and mySQL.</p>
<p>The service being provided, that of secure online shopping, is not new. The
unique vision behind this exciting open source offering, is that it is FREE and
meant to be distributed. Chambers of commerce, or sustainable living business
organizations now have a free tool to increase local business through the useof
the internet. Using ideas that savvy internet surfers are already familiar with:
user reviews, searchable inventory, map directions, etc., it offers consumers an
opportunity to find a specific productâ€¦down the street. To implement this secure
online shopping solution, an organization will require the hardware and software
specified in the download instructions, as well as a website administrator.</p>

Select the distance range from the pulldown menu, and, enter your zipcode.</p>

category tree with links on the right hand side.</p>
<p>If you would prefer to browse by online map location, this feature will be
available soon.</p>
<h2>Purchasing a Product</h2>
<p>This feature is not offered yet.</p>
<p>Questions on all sales should be referred to the store/vendor you purchased
from, so make sure that contact information is available before your purchase.
Consumers use this site at their own risk: RPI is hosting this site as a public
service to locally-owned independent businesses, but it makes no guarantees
about the accuracy of the information they provide or the safety of the products
they sell.</p>
<h2>Viewing a Product</h2>
<p>Some products cannot be added to the shopping cart as they are not for online
sale, but only for view. To purchase these products, please contact the
vendor/store and make arrangements with them directly.</p>
<h2>Flagging Vendors</h2>
<p>If a vendor is offering verbal abuse on their store site, please flag them
for the administrator to review.</p>

<p>If a particular product is offensive, please flag it for the administrator to
review.</p>

('Info Vendor FAQ Text', '<h2>Vendor Registration</h2>
<p>Registering as a vendor is as simple as giving your name, username, valid
email address and zipcode.</p>
<p>The emphasis of this website is to give opportunity for inexpensive online
advertising and sales to local businesses that are already established in the
community. We define \'business\' loosely -- if you are part of the local
community, and you have a product or service to provide then you can register as
a vendor.</p>
<p>This includes such things as "used DVDs" and "antique picture frames", OR,
"wedding makeup", "mowing lawns", "furniture refinishing".</p>
<p>As for new businesses -- the burden of establishing your business in the
community is on you. This is just another tool and probably not the one you
should be concentrating on if you are a brand new business.</p>
<h2>Listing Products and Services</h2>
<p>By default, for liability issues, you will only able to list products \'for
view\' enabling foot traffic to your store. It is up to the admin of the website
to enable online transactions. If online transactions are enabled, you will be
also able to list products \'for sale\' if you have a paypal account (please put
in a link to the paypal webpage). Then online sale transactions will be enabled
for your store similar to the use of such websites as Amazon Marketplace or
Ebay. However, all product listings must be legal, or they will be removed by
the site administrator when flagged.</p>
<p>We expect some nontraditional listings, for example, restaurants might list
reservation time and date slots \'for view\' or a certified nanny or masseuse
might list their time and date availability. Yard sales are welcome, as well as
book signings by local authors, and, local artist shows.</p>
<h2>Enabling Business and Product Rating</h2>

problem.</p>');
