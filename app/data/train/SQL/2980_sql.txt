/*
These are rules for creating SQL files:

- SQL files have .sql extension;
- name format is 123_SOME_NAME.sql, meaning a 3 char number +"_"+small text uppercase;
- can be executed "bulk" in any SQLite manager (ex: Database.NET);
- can have single line/multi line comments;
- table name should be uppercase (ex: USERS);
- keep SQL keywords also uppercase (ex: CREATE TABLE ABC);
- column names should be cammelCase (ex: idUser);
- can comment a specific column about content format (ex: UUID of 32: 'E22454524C8615D59B701AEBDE92ABEC'
- place PRIMARY KEY declaration at end of table;
- each new file will have a greater version than last one (ex: 009 -> 010 -> 011)
