# 1417. Weighing Problem
# Gives nn coins, each weighing 10g, but the weight of one coin is 11g. There
#  is now a balance that can be accurately weighed. Ask at least a few times
# to be sure to find the 11g gold coin.
#
# Example
# Given n = 3, return 1.
#
# Explanation:
# Select two gold coins on the two ends of the balance. If the two ends of
# the balance are level, the third gold coin is 11g, otherwise the heavy one
# is 11g.
# Given n = 4, return 2.
#
# Explanation:
# Four gold coins can be divided into two groups and placed on both ends of
# the scale. According to the weighing results, select the two heavy gold
# coins and place them on the two ends of the balance for the second
# weighing. The gold coin at the heavy end is 11g gold coins.
