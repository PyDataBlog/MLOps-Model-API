	// the balance across VLANs. If there is ambiguity about which member to use to maintain balance, the
	// terminationPolicy is used to resolve it. This is false by default and can only be set to true if

	BalancedTerminationFlag bool `json:"balancedTerminationFlag,omitempty"`

	// Cooldown - The number of seconds this group will wait after lastActionDate before performing another

	// It will be null when retrieved. When this value is provided on create or edit, guests will be scaled
	// up or down to meet this number. This number must be in the range provided by minimumMemberCount and

	// MaximumMemberCount - The greatest number of virtual guest members that are allowed on this group.
	// Any attempts to add a guest member will fail if it will result in the total guest member count of
	// this group to be above this number. If this number is edited and is less than the current guest
	// member count, guests will be removed to at least be no greater than this number.

	// VirtualGuestMemberTemplate - This is the template to create guest members with. This is the same
	// template accepted by the createObject call on SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest with some caveats. The

	// hourlyBillingFlag cannot be false, and if the datacenter is provided it must be in the region of
	// this group. Finally, VLANs cannot be provided for the template, it will use VLANs provided to this
	// group instead. Note, if this template is edited on an existing group the previous template values
	// are not kept and are not considered during termination. This means a group's guest members could
	// effectively be a hybrid of multiple templates because this value was changed after some guest
	// members were created but before others were created.
