// softlayer_network_storage_iscsi - SoftLayer's iscsi product extends upon the base functionality of
// SoftLayer offerings by providing snapshot and replication capabilities. An iscsi volume is mounted
// through SoftLayer's private network and allows for block level additional storage on a highly
// redundant disk array. SoftLayer's iscsi offering is capable of taking volume snapshots which can be
// mounted read-only or used for an immediate volume data restore. This high-end Storage offering is
// also capable of being configured for remote data replication to any of SoftLayer's datacenters to
// provide a solid disaster recovery solution.
