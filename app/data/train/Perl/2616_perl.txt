  The New York-based United Federation of Teachers, a 150,000-member
  teachers union for New York City's teachers in the city's five
  boroughs and 1,300 schools, has moved their site from a proprietary
  Windows-based system to a new system built on mod_perl and other open
  source technologies.
  
  The site uses the (mod_perl-based) Krang content management system
  (http://krang.sf.net/) for publishing, enabling a wider range of
  people to contribute content with a consistent look-and-feel and a
  workflow system to handle the review process.  The new site also
  features integration with the union's existing AS/400 systems, and
  further integration work is underway to bring more resources on-line
  for a wider audience.
  
  My company, Plus Three (http://plusthree.com/) did the technical work
  on this project.  Plus Three specializes in helping large non-profit
  and political organizations achieve their goals with open source
  software.
