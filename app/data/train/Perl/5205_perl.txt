# Solution for:
# Cut the sticks
# https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/cut-the-sticks

# We don't need to know how many sticks there are from stdin (we'll split and loop)
<>;

# Sort the length of all the sticks, lowest first
my @sticks = sort {$a<=>$b} split(/\s/,<>);

# While we have sticks left, loop over them
while(@sticks) {
	# The first stick is the lowest stick
	$min = $sticks[0];
	
	# Print out how many sticks we have
	print ~~@sticks,"\n";
	
	# While we still have sticks and the lowest stick matches
	# the current one remove it (since we cut by it's size).
	while(~~@sticks && $sticks[0] == $min) {
		shift(@sticks);
	}
}
