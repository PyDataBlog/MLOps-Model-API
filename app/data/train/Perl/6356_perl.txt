=head1 NAME

DNSCheck::Locale - Translation of message tags to human-readable strings

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Module to take internal message tags used by DNSCheck and convert them into 
human-readable text messages in any of the supported languages.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new()

For internal use only. To get an object, use L<DNSCheck::locale()>.

=head2 expand($tag, @args)

Convert the given tag using the given arguments. If the C<@args> list doesn't 
have exactly the same number of elements as the translation for the tag 
requires, a warning message will be issued on STDERR. If the tag can't be found 
in the currently configured language environment, a fallback message will be 
generated.
