=head1 ABSTRACT

Perl used to use $pkg'var instead of the modern $pkg::var. This is still
in Perl 5. It's gotta go.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

See above.

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

See above.

=head1 NOTES ON FREEZE

Damian worried that this would mean Klingon.pm would no longer be
portable to Perl 6. He failed to convince other people on the list that
this was actually a bad thing. ;-) (kidding!!)

=head1 REFERENCES

Camel-3 p. 60 reminded me of this.
