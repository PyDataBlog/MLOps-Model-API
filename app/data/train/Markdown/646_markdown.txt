<h3>Road map</h3>
The first hackathon on October 18th was hugely successful! We now have the foundation for an interactive video framework. Feel free to submit pull-requests with additional features, but we're currently refactoring all the code that was merged into a more intuitive structure, restyling the components to match the visual style of Fluency, and adding additional functionality to the framework.

We have an internal feature wish list that we'll share once we push this initial refactor to the repo. The subsequent feature set will include (but is not limited to!) screen transitions, parallax, and a wizard for webvtt.

More hack days to come!
