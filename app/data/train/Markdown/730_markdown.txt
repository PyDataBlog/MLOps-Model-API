# TobiiEyetracking
This is the repository storing the codes for Tobii eye-tracking cases, including the application of Tobii and corresponding various methods of data analysis. 

The utility of Tobii for experiment and design is mostly based on Matlab.
The data analysis consists of codes based on Matlab and R. I will try to create a consistent work soon.
