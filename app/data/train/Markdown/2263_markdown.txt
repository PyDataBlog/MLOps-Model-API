Linguist, data scientist, math tutor, photographer, and cook! I love patterns, numbers, and playing around with language. Been living in the Bay Area for the past few years. Originally from LA and lived in Boston before SF. Excited to apply my skills as a linguist and data scientist to present day communication problems.
