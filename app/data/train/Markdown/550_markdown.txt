# Rspec Thinking Sphinx matchers
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Govinda-Fichtner/rspec-thinking-sphinx-matchers.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Govinda-Fichtner/rspec-thinking-sphinx-matchers)

Test your Thinking Sphinx 3 index defintions with the custom rspec matchers of this gem.

If you are still using Thinking Sphinx 2 have a look at https://github.com/fuzzyalej/thinking-sphinx-rspec-matchers

I would appreciate feedback very much, in the form of comments, code and/or beer! :-)


# Installation
To install the matchers you only have to add the gem to your test group in `Gemfile`:

     group :test do
       gem 'rspec-thinking-sphinx-matchers'
     end

And then execute:

    $ bundle

# Use
     describe "fields" do
       it { should index :name, :from => :client, :as => :client_name }
       it { should index :content }
     end
    
     describe "attributes" do
       it { should have_attribute :user_id, :as => :users }
     end

Field options

        :from
        :as
        :facet
        :sortable

Attribute Field options

        :from
