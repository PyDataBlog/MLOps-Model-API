CMPUT 301 - A1 - To Do List Application (written in Java)

An application to create and store a list of items. You can check
the items off after completion, email items, and keep track
of completed and uncompleted items.

Notes
=====
1. The selection feature in the E-Mail function does not work.
The only option to e-mail currently only sends the complete ToDo List
and Archive List. Bug involved in referencing multiple objects in ListView. Possible solution
in E-Mail Adapter or the E-Mail Activity files requires an OnClick multiple 
items reference.

Backend implementation of emailSelectArray developed for this function 
but could not sort out the bugs.

Currently the buttons are disabled for these options to avoid 
confusion with the markers.

2. Data Serialization back-end implemented but not active. Current bug
in data streams from OnCreate to OnStart where save file overwrites
display ArrayLists. Problem in the way the display is generated
or sorting out data references. Sections commented out in 
Activity Java, back-end implementation available for viewing.


Quick Guide
===========
1. Use overflow bar to navigate through activities. If no overflow bar use the hardwired menu button in the emulator.

2. OnClick Archive. On Long Click Deletes.

3. Archive Menu, Email, and Stats activities are visited through the menu bar/button (on the right of the emulator)

Full Instructions
============

====
NOTE
====
Check to see if the Action Bar has an overflow icon. If the icon is not there you need to select the menu button
to switch between the activities. The menu button on the right in the emulator is the hard wired menu button
for the phone version. This acts as the overflow button in the Action Bar and will navigate activities sucessfully.

Navigating between views require you to move from the Action bar in the MainMenu and the back button in the Android menu. 

1. Selecting
	Allows for archive or delete functions.

2. Adding
	In the main ToDoList view you can add items to the list by typing into
	the text field and pressing the add icon. This will update the
	ToDoList

3. Archiving
	In both the main ToDoList view and the Archive view you must click the row
	to archive or unarchive the ToDoList Item. A prompt will popup to verify this change.
	
	In the ToDoList main view this will move our item to the archive.
	The archive can be accessed with the first icon on the action bar.
		
	The archive uses the same methods of the onClick method to unarchive items
	and you can select or unselect the check box per item.
	
	As well the archive and the main TodDoList uses the same Delete function

4. Delete
	In both the main ToDoList view and the Archive view you must longclick the row
	to delete the ToDoList Item. A prompt will pop up to verify this change.
	This will delete the item from the system.

5. Email
	At the moment select email does not work. However using the view provided you can
	email either the full ToDo list (under email) or the full Archive (under Email Archive).
	
	This should launch a popup that references your email app.

6. Statistics
	In the action bar on the top right on the in menu you may select the information icon.
	This loads up the statistics page where you can watch the app keep track of the internal
	number of ToDoList Items
	

To Do Fixes/Considerations
==========================
1. Consider adding a self.emailcheck field in ListItem to implement E-Mail Selection using
check boxes. Create LayoutXML and populate listview with current method.

2. Background color fill to improve highlighting/selection actions.
