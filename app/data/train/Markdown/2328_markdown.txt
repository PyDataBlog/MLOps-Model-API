# Usage for packageRemover

Copy the file to /usr/local/bin/

Give the file permission to run with: chmod 777 (username) packageRemover

The scripts looks for every .java file in the directory where it is executed and echoes the found files.

It uses a regular expression to find package statements in the files and removes it with $ sed

Statements that are going to be removed:

# Method

1. package
2. any whitespace, but not newline
3. multi-line comment in a single line (/* test */)
4. any whitespace, but not newline
5. One package name consisting of at least one lowercase letter and optionally other lowercase letters or numbers
6. Multiple package names starting with a dot
4. any whitespace, but not newline
7. Semicolon
8. newline

# Examples

Will be removed:

    package noot;
    package noot.noot;
    package /* why would do this?*/ noot.noot;

Will NOT be removed:
 
         package noot;       (or any other indentation)
    package .noot.noot;     (not a proper package)
    package ;               (there has to be a package name)
    package noot
    ;                       (obviously the semicolon is in the wrong line)

# Exceptions

    package /*

    */ noot.noot;

The regular expression only looks at single lines, therefore multiline comments can break the statement up.
Maybe a fix in the future

Any files encoded in UTF-8 *with* BOM will not be edited, as the BOM counts as a symbol in shell
