# Circuits and software

The basics. Take a close look at your arduino board you will find all kinds of writing on it. What's most important is the things designating the pins on the board. Mostly numbers from 0 to 13.

## 0. How to wire a breadboard

Breadboards are super simple, which is good because you'll use it a lot. A breadboard lets you make a circuit without all the fuss of soldering things, fumbling with wrapping components together or just holding very still with everything.

A circuit is a loop of conductive material, that's it. As I'm sure you know, this is usually metal.

The breadboard helps you make a loop because the holes in it are a lot of rows connected up, separated by a gap in the middle and two columns either side to run electricity up and down. See all the metal strips as pictured?![metal strips under a breadboard?](breadboard_back.png).

## 1. Flash the built in LED

Get the board plugged in and upload to it the example that comes with the software. `File -> Examples -> Basics -> Blink`

When you upload it watch the board and note what it's doing.

## 2 Flash your own LED

Get out the following;

1. Any LED
2. 1 560Ohm Resistor

Using some wires from the kit put your parts into the breadboard so that the signal (power) will come from the correct pin, through the resistor, through the LED and finally down to a ground (any GND pin).

# What did you learn?
#### Can you answer these yourself?

1. How small can the speed be and you can still see which LED is on and which is off.
1. The same `flip` function runs for both LEDs. Why don't both LEDs light up and go off at the same time?
1. What LED lights when you first boot the board up?
1. Why?
1. Can you describe what a function is?
1. What is the syntax of a function?
