Serialization PHP Caching (SPC)
===============

While APC caching and Memcache caching requires libraries to be installed, SPC does not.
SPC is a key value based caching system, which creates, edits and deletes txt files.
All data is stored serialized.

SPC caching 'does' work on shared hosting! No installing required, just include SPC.php and let the fun begin.
