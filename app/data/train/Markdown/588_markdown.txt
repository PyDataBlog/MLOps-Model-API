Netcat-like command agent for MCollective
=========================================

Why?
----

Do you need to send commands to a daemon in plaintext over TCP? I do :-)
That is the only purpose after this agent plugin, to be able to send
commands in plaintext to some daemons.

How does it work?
-----------------

Simple, having MCollective daemon and this agent in all the needed hosts,
there must be an entry in /etc/hosts for localhost and that's all.

The plugin will open a socket to localhost <port> and send the command
in plaintext, will read the answer from the daemon (or service) and report
it back.

In case of any ERRNO, will fail reporting the error message.


Sample
------

```
sergio@puppetagent02:~$ mco rpc netcat echocmd cmd="Are you there" port=8111
Discovering hosts using the mc method for 2 second(s) .... 4

 * [ ============================================================> ] 4 / 4

puppetagent02                            Unknown Request Status
   Connection refused - connect(2)
