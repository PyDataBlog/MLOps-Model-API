# TDDFT Code

Currently, the code is built with the following include directories.  The code will find .o files it needs in these directories:

```
$QEHOME/PW/src/
$QEHOME/Modules
$QEHOME/iotk/src
$QEHOME/include
```
where `QEHOME` is the root directory of the quantum espresso package.

and uses these libraries
```
$QEHOME/PW/src/libpw.a
$QEHOME/Modules/libqemod.a
$QEHOME/flib/ptools.a
$QEHOME/flib/flib.a
$QEHOME/clib/clib.a
$QEHOME/iotk/src/libiotk.a
-lopenblas
-lfftw3
-lopenblas
```

This means that most of the functions, subroutines, and modules that the tddft source uses are found in the first four directories above.

### Recommended way to parse these markdown files

1. Start reading `tddft_main.md`.  This markdown file describes `ttdft_main.f90`, the file containing the Fortran `program` construct, which is like a C/C++ `main` function. Code execution begins from here.
2. Whenever an <span style="color:orange;">orange</span> block appears, it is an indication to start reading another file inside this directory. These instructions are written assuming you have read all orange blocks up to that point in the text.
