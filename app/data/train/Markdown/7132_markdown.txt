This is just a shameless plug to promote the work I publish at [Telekom.com](https://www.telekom.com/en/blog/592636-592636). My posts over there are about threat intelligence and especially malware analysis. For instance, I gave an overview of the [current toolset of TA505](https://www.telekom.com/en/blog/group/article/cybersecurity-ta505-s-box-of-chocolate-597672) or I scrutinized the [latest plugins of the infamous Emotet botnet](https://www.telekom.com/en/blog/group/article/cybersecurity-dissecting-emotet-part-two-596128). They are profoundly researched and very detailed: So have a look now!
