# pfsense-backup

The goal of this little PHP project is to gain automated config backups from a pfsense box.

## Features

- Simple configuration via XML file
- Backups can be saved locally or may be sent to one or more e-mail-recipients
- Supports backup of multiple pfsense instances
- Simple backup comparison tool

## Requirements
- min. PHP 5.5 with cURL
- some server running cron jobs

## Installation and Setup

The code in this repo needs to be deployed to a web server. Make sure user write permissions for `/var/` and subfolders are set.

To load all composer requirements and includes please make sure to initialize and update composer in project root.

The subfolder `/etc/` contains a sample config file called `/etc/config.xml`. Settings can be made there, although it is recommended to make a copy called `/etc/config.local.xml` in the same folder and make settings there.

With options in the config-file set, the script can be run by visiting this URL:
`https://localhost/pfsense-backup/cron.php`

Please adjust the file paths in `/compare/.htaccess`

Errors are usually either permission- or config related.

For regular runs using the crontab-module of a Unix server is recommended. Sample config for a Linux server:

`sudo crontab -e`

`0 3 * * * wget -q --spider https://localhost/pfsense-backup/cron.php`

The script will then be run every day at 3AM

## Configuration

General script configuration:
```xml
<general>
    <charset>UTF-8</charset>
    <timezone>Europe/Berlin</timezone>
    <heartbeat_url>http://your-heartbeat-tracker.example.com/pulse/pfsense-backup</heartbeat_url>
    <!-- A ping will be send to this url after successful backup. Leave empty if you like. -->
    <frontend_url>http://localhost/pfsense-backup/</frontend_url>
</general>
```

Main script behavior configuration:
```xml
<backup>
    <pfsense01>
        <title>Your first pfSense name</title>

            <store>
                <target_directory><![CDATA[/var/www/html/pfsense-backup/var/backups/]]></target_directory> <!-- Please use an absolute path here if possible -->
                <override_file>1</override_file> <!-- 1 or 0 - if 1 the backup file will be overwritten with each script execution -->
            </store>
        </mode_configs>
    </pfsense01>
</backup>
```

Outbox-configuration is optional. The credentials entered here will be used to send the actual backups as well as log files.

<outbox>
    <sender_address>pfsense-backup@example.com</sender_address>
    <sender_name>pfSense-Backup</sender_name>
    <smtp>
        <host>smtp.example.com</host>
        <port>25</port>
        <encryption>tls</encryption>

        <password>yoursecretmailpwd</password>
    </smtp>
</outbox>
```

Log settings:
```xml
<log>

## Compare Tool

The Compare Tool bundled with this backup script can be found under ``http://localhost/pfsense-backup/compare/`` (dependent on your deployment environment). It is secured by Basic Auth via .htaccess. **Make sure to set the correct file paths in ``/compare/.htaccess``!** The default credentials are:

- Username: ``admin``
- Password: ``pfsense-backup``

To adjust the account settings please edit ``/compare/.htusers`` and ``/compare/.htgroups`` .
