# Users

With the **Enterprise Edition** there are two categories of users which have different roles and permissions.

## General Users

General users of the **Enterprise Edition** have the same permissions and features at hand as compared to users of the **Community Edition**. The only difference is, that new users need to be invited by an administrator and can't simply sign up. Further they are not allowed to invite or add new users.

## Administrators

Administrators (admins) of the **Enterprise Edition** have access to the administration area of the website to manage general users, admin users, but also Projects, Protocols, Measurements, etc. The purpose of the admin is purely to manage the page, content and users.

::: warning  Note
An admin user is not permitted to login to the web app, desktop app, or mobile app. The admin must also be added as a general user in order to contribute data and collaborate on projects via the web, desktop, and mobile applications.
