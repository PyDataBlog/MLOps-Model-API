# Description

Place for a vbkick templates which requires a bit more love before will be moved to [templates repository](https://github.com/wilas/vbkick-templates).

Some templates because of their nature (e.g development, experimental) will never be moved, a good example for this is Debian "Sid".

To learn how templates are organized please read about good practice in [templates repository](https://github.com/wilas/vbkick-templates).

Note1: Don't expect that all templates available here are working, but don't affraid try any of them.

Note2: Feel free to create a new template and make a pull request.
