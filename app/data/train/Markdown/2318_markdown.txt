## Introduction

This is a simple tool that I use in (almost) every app. It is nothing fancy, just convenience. I like things nicely aligned, and this makes it really easy. Once you've tried it, you'll be hooked.

## Description

ARFramesInGridCalculator is a single class that will calculate frames in a grid that you specified. Useful for placing buttons, images, textfields, etc. Your designer changed his mind? ARFramesInGridCalculator makes it really simple to adjust the layout to match design specifications. And it makes it really easy to display your content dynamically based on the available bounds and number of items.

## Usage

Initialize with a `cellSize` and information about how to arrange the cells. If you set rowCount to `0` there will be no limit on the amount of rows calculated.


```
	ARFramesInGridCalculator *calculator = [[ARFramesInGridCalculator alloc] initWithCellSize:CGSizeMake(80.0, 30.0) rowCount:0 columnCount:2 andDirection:ARFramesInGridDirectionHorizontal];
```



Optionally set the `initialOffset` and `cellSpacing` properties.

The method `frameForIndex:` is what you will use most. For example:

```
	for (int i = 0; i < 14; i ++)
	{
		UILabel *test = [[UILabel alloc] initWithFrame:[calculator frameForIndex:i]];
		[self.gridContainerView addSubview:test];
	}
```


There are more methods availabele wich are documented in the header file but worth mentioning here:

- To calculate the resulting cell width when margin is fixed:
`setCellWidthToFitWidth:count:horizontalMargin:`*

- For a given cell width and totalWidth, calculate margin for even layout.
`setHorizontalMarginForTotalWidth:cellWidth:count:`*

\* When using these methods `cellSize.width`, `initialOffset.x` and `cellSpacing.width` will all be set;



## Installation
