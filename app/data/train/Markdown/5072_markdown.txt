#Your Star Wars Name:  

NOTE: There is no "default" python file for this code. You'll need to create a new python file and add your code. Make sure to add the file to the git repository. (git add .)


Rumor has it that George Lucas may use a "formula" to create all of those strange sounding names you see in the Star Wars trilogy and the Phantom Menace (Jar Binks, ObiWan, etc.).  

To see what your Star Wars name might be according to the suggested "formula",
follow the steps below....

##Your Star Wars First Name:

1.  Take the first 3 letters of your last name.
2.  Add to that, the first 2 letters of your first name.

##Your Star Wars Last Name:

1.  Take the first 2 letters of your mother's maiden name.
2.  Add the first 3 letters of the name of the town in which you were born.

##Code it!  
Write a program that does the following steps:  
1. Prompt the user to input their First and Last name and their mother's maiden name and the city where they where born.  
2. Calculate their "Star Wars" name.  
3. Print out their "Star Wars" name.

Remember that you can slice a string with [ ]
