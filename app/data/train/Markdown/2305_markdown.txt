A recent curiousity in emberjs drove me to spend some time discovering how the language works and its possibilities. I had one problem though, the only computer I had access to had Windows 10 installed on it. Right now you probably thinking to yourself "Why is that a problem?" Well, its not.

Due to working everyday on a Linux computer I have grown to love the power of its terminal and its vast capabilities. This ofcourse has also skewed my preferences in terms of where I would like to spend my time discovering and what type of console I would like to use.

Yes! Lets install Virtualbox, create a virtual machine and install Linux and we will be ready to go! Oh wait lets not forget Virtualboxes Linux guest editions so we can view our virtual machine with a full resolution.

If you have ever experienced a situation like this you will know how fustrating this development environment can be. I decided to take an alternative approach. I wanted the power of Linux but wanted to keep my base operating system as Windows and here is a cool solution I discovered.
<br /><br />

## Step 1
The first thing I decided to do was install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win). This comes with some really cool things off the bat like Git Bash. Git Bash also has **ssh** functionality by default which will help you to connect to your Linux VM once you have setup


## Step 2
You need to have [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) or another Virtual Machine Manager before proceeding with this step

Next I created a virtual machine and installed Linux Ubuntu (can be any distro, I just chose this one). I then proceeded to install openssh on my Linux machine. This can be done by running the following commands(Ubuntu):

~~~ bash
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
~~~

I then set the network settings on my Virtual Machine to **Bridged Adapter** and ran the following command to get its IP address

~~~ bash
ifconfig
~~~

_Im assuming here that between this step and the next the password on the machine won't change. If it does change then please check your network configuration_


## Step 3

Power off your virtual machine and start it up again but in **Headless Mode**.


## Step 4
On your windows machine open Git Bash and ssh into your virtual machine. You can do this by running:

~~~ bash
ssh username@ipaddress
~~~

So in my case:

**My virtual machines IP Address:** 10.0.0.2

**My username:** bob

So the command will be:

~~~ bash
ssh bob@10.0.0.2
~~~

You will then be requested to input your password which is the password you entered when installing Linux onto your Virtual Machine.

If you want you can also run:

~~~ bash
ssh-copy-id bob@10.0.0.2
~~~

This will then also request a password from you. But once you have entered it, instead of logging you onto the machine it will provide you with the ability to login to the machine without a password in future.

Great! we have a Linux terminal environment we can work with. One problem... what about my favourite IDE? or my awesome text editor?
