In November 2009:

* [Andy R][andy-r] took stock of [his musical career](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2009/11/02/brain-dump-2009/), and listed some of his [favourite albums](http://paganwandererlu.wordpress.com/2009/11/18/top-albums/) of the last decade.

* [Claire][claire] announced that she and [Dan][dan] had [broken up](http://nowebsite.co.uk/blog/2009/11/the-break-up/), and asked for the support of their friends.

* [Dan][dan] also announced his and [Claire][claire]'s [break-up](http://www.scatmania.org/2009/11/01/the-break-up/), and reminded people that nobody wanted anybody to "take sides". He later wrote [his first murder mystery](http://www.scatmania.org/2009/11/23/murder-in-the-reign-of-terror/) (which [Ruth][ruth] did most of the work to host). Finally, this month, he [thanked his friends](http://www.scatmania.org/2009/11/26/my-friends-are-amazing/) for their support following his and [Claire][claire]'s split, and announced that, as he now had little reason to stay, he'd be leaving Aberystwyth in the New Year.

* [JTA][jta] listed the [pros & cons](http://blog.electricquaker.co.uk/2009/11/12/working-for-the-nhs-pros-cons/) of working for the NHS.

* [Liz][liz] and Simon [moved house](http://norasdollhouse.livejournal.com/106345.html).

* [Rory][rory] got [vaccinated](http://razinaber.livejournal.com/108740.html), and then listed some ['off the beaten track' places to visit in Tokyo](http://razinaber.livejournal.com/108832.html).

* [Ruth][ruth] watched [her CEO crack](http://fleeblewidget.livejournal.com/164237.html), missed [the Abnib/Rockmonkey chat rooms](http://fleeblewidget.livejournal.com/164466.html), found [a comment](http://fleeblewidget.livejournal.com/164800.html) on some code she didn't mean to leave there, noted [the death of Geocities](http://fleeblewidget.livejournal.com/164952.html), [planned](http://fleeblewidget.livejournal.com/165199.html) to retire in 2049, [argued](http://fleeblewidget.livejournal.com/165383.html) with her Google Search results, shared [strange sentiments](http://fleeblewidget.livejournal.com/165747.html) expressed via Google Autocomplete, and echoed [Dan][dan]'s invitiation to [Murder... In Space!](http://fleeblewidget.livejournal.com/166055.html).

* [Sian][sian] sorted out her and [Andy][andy-r]'s [wedding plans](http://elgingerbread.wordpress.com/2009/11/11/today-i-met-the-boy-im-gonna-marry/), featured on [a postcard](http://elgingerbread.wordpress.com/2009/11/12/cry-postcard-launch/), and was [photographed](http://elgingerbread.wordpress.com/2009/11/30/275/) being adorable with [Andy][andy-r].
