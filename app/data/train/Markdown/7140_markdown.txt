title: Feature Film Friday - Nancy Drew Reporter
---
It's friday! That means it's time for movies! At least that's what it means this week, who knows if that's what it will mean next week! Today's movie is called _Nancy Drew, Reporter_. It was released in 1939, and it's a fun, rollicking romp. ![nancyuntitled.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/nancyuntitled.jpg)


The film is based on the character Nancy Drew, from the series of detective novels. I loved Nancy Drew novels as a kid, and I was over the moon with most of this screen incarnation of the character. I could have done without the musical number, but it was the 30s. You couldn't have a family film without a musical number. 

Reading Nancy Drew books as a kid, it seemed perfectly natural for a young woman in the 30s to have her own car, and to be investigating murders. Watching it play out on screen it seems a little less natural, but no less fun. 

My favorite part of this film was when the sidekick and the police officer played Rummy for pennies. I used to do the same thing with my grandmother, after reading Nancy Drew novels. Another thing about this film that I really enjoyed were the cars! They are all running bords and rumble seats and slick tires, which is neat.
