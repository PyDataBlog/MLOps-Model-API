**I don't know how I got here** But I did.

The gif above is appropriate on how I felt and feel when I saw that I am on the final projects and that my own CLI Gem will be soon. I feel like I am not grasping concepts as much as I would like, yet I am getting through the labs and with the wonderful help of my friends. 

These past few days have been tough, personally, and if you don't want to read the personal part please scroll on! For many years I have struggled with digestive issues. I got my gallbladder out 10 years ago and I always thought I had issues with food but I didn’t realize it would get this bad. Almost if not, every day, I have found myself with serious stomach pains to the point where I didn’t feel comfortable leaving my apartment. 

I paid attention and I would get sick if I had dairy or gluten problems. After speaking with my doctor, I decided that I would cut as much lactose and gluten that I can out of my life. I am on day 3 – and I cheated, I had some dairy ice cream last night but a small amount and I was okay – and eating oatmeal instead of a bagel. It crushes my stomach.  

How does this relate to my school work? Well I’ve been in so much pain I couldn’t sit and be at the computer for more than a few hours. I was also extremely tired and felt like I had a cold. After just 3 days, I am not as tired and feel much better immune wise.  

Thanks to the channel #learn-health, I got some pretty great advice about supplements for people without gallbladders, which I then called my gerontologist and he confirmed it would be a good step. I really am making some great friendships on Slack and you know who you are if you are reading this, thank you so much for your support.  

Yesterday was a tough day for me. Here I was, second day lactose free, gluten free and I was trying to cook something but it ended up taking all day so I was unable to get much done with my project. 

Today will be better.
