## Registering your agent with the server

For security reasons, all newly installed GoCD agents need to be enabled on the GoCD server before work is assigned to them. This prevents an unauthorized person from getting access to your source code. To enable a newly installed GoCD agent, do the following:

1. Open the GoCD server dashboard
2. Follow the instructions [here](../../../configuration/managing_a_build_cloud.html) to find the agent you've just installed on the list and add the agent to your cloud. The GoCD server will now schedule work for this agent.
