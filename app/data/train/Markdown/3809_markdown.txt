## 1.1 Think About Time

Submitted this already however it did not register I suppose...

I learned about habit formation, time boxing, meditation, growth vs fixed mindset and the pomodoro technique to name a few. Time Boxing is where the individual allocates a fixed amount of time for a specific goal as opposed to completion for that goal. Currently I manage my time by attending to important emails and administrative items, coding and computer work and job application and search in the morning. And then complete chores, exercise, social obligations and personal goals in the afternoon and evening. I use calendar invites to myself and personal alarms during the week that I set immediately so I don't forget important events. My current strategy seems to be working, I may have to decrease time spent on personal goals and job search activities to account for increased time load at DBC. I may employ the pomodoro technique if I become quite busy.

## 1.2 The Command Line

Q What is a shell? What is "bash?"
Shell is the command line interface, bash is Unix for Mac.

Q What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?

The most challenging for me was environment variables, still a bit fuzzy on those and pipes and redirection

Q Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?

Yes

Q In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?

So far I think the most important commands to know are making a directory copying a directory, making a new file. change directory.

Q Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

Commands:

pwd - print working directory

ls - list

mv - move directory

cd - change directory

../ - move back a directory

touch - create a file

mkdir - make a directory

less - list file contents (open file in unix)

rmdir - remove directory

rm - remove directory and contents

help (man) - help screen with descriptions of commands 

## 1.4 Create, Fork, and Clone Repositories

If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?
Instructions on how to create/fork/clone a new repo: 

Go to your GitHub acct, navigate to the green "+" button and create a new repository. Name said new repository and add license to the repository. 

If you want to fork a repo hit the fork button and click on your GitHub account (fork button on GitHub seems to automatically navigate to my account as it is my only GitHub account) 

If you want to clone a repo, for example one that you forked, you copy the clone HTTPS on GitHub, go to the directory you want to add it to in the command line, type 'git clone' and paste in the HTTPS URL. 

You would fork a repo as opposed to create a new one if you wanted to add to an existing project, particularly an open source project where you could modify the code separately. Creating a new repo is like creating a new file in MS Word vs. modifying an existing MS Word doc.  

What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
I tried to figure out how to install git hub on the command line and wasn't exactly sure if it was already on my machine. Also in creating a new repo and cloning it to my machine (the terminal) I followed some steps on GitHub that seemed to push it to the terminal using commands like "git remote add origin (url)" and "git push -u origin master"  which produced a 403 error, so not sure what was up there. 

The video was helpful as well as reading the instructions just before and just after the video. I learned about the clone command and how to create a repo!
