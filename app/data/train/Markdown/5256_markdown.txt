## Philosophy

The following principles are considered to be axioms for us, and in case you
are thinking about the opportunity to join The Guild, please read them all
and decide for yourself.

 - We believe that OpenArena is unique, thanks mostly to its community. We like 
   both OpenArena and its community very much.
 - *Having a good sportsmanship is* **very important**. We are old-timers in this
   game, we respect other players and we are respected by others.
   Even when a game turns bad, we stay under control and keep it cool. We compliment
   our opponents when we lose a fair game. *We want to maintain a positive reputation 
   within OA community*.
   So if you want to be among us, take into account that behaviours such as flaming,
   spamming, cheating, any kinds of unfair play or disrespect for others are
   strongly discouraged.
 - Even if winning is not the utmost priority for us, we are a team of skillful players.
   *If you want to be among us, have some skill.* Otherwise keep practicing, we were
   all newbies once at some point.
 - We believe that there are many ways of improving/developing OA (or set
   of related technologies). We have [some ideas](https://github.com/OAGuild)
   and we are trying to work on it apart from other gaming activities.
 - We enjoy any types of *Clans action*, especially participation in *Clan Wars*.
   The Guild makes efforts to organize it. We hope that one fine day the former
   popularity of clans and clans rivalry will revive in OA.
 - Another important thing is to *have fun*. We take pleasure in playing together.
   We like each other. ;) We also use the game as a way of communication.
   If you don't have fun in the game, you are doing it wrong :p


## History

The story began in October 2016, when the idea of creating new,
special (means based on the ideas listed above) and innovative clan/team
first came to my mind. Taking into account that no large-scale or really
significant events have happened yet, simple and short events list seems
to be enough. Information on any important events will be published in
the main section of the site in the form of posts.
