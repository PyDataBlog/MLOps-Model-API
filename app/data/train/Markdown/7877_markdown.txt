eduProxy is a SAML Proxy acting as a Identity Provider for all eduGain Service Providers and
acting as a ServiceProvider in the OpenConext SAML Federation

The Proxy behaviour can be configured in order for the eduProxy to be used as a generic IdP-SP SAML proxy with hooks
for authnResponse 'enrichment'.

## [Getting started](#getting-started)

### [System Requirements](#system-requirements)

- Java 7
- Maven 3

### [Building and running](#building-and-running)

This project uses Spring Boot and Maven. To run locally, type:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

When developing, it's convenient to just execute the applications main-method, which is in [Application](src/main/java/eduproxy/Application.java).

## [SAML metadata](#saml-metadata)

The eduProxy metadata is generated and accessible on [http://localhost:8080/sp/metadata](http://localhost:8080/sp/metadata)
and [http://localhost:8080/idp/metadata](http://localhost:8080/idp/metadata). The metadata is cached and refreshed every 24 hours. This
can be configured:

```yml
proxy:
  # duration of metadata cache (1 day)
  validity_duration_metadata_ms: 86400000
```

The Service Providers allowed to connect to the eduProxy are provided in a Metadata feed configured in ```application.yml```:

```yml
serviceproviders:
  feed: http://mds.edugain.org/
```
By default - but easily changed / overridden - all Service Providers in the SAML metadata feed
are allowed to connect. See [ServiceProviderFeedParser](src/main/java/eduproxy/saml/ServiceProviderFeedParser.java).

The feed can also be a file url when developing locally:

```yml
serviceproviders:
  feed: classpath:saml/edugain.xml
```

When developing locally or deploying in a test environment eduProxy can be configured to allow any SP to connect by
setting `serviceproviders.allow_unknown` to `true`. This is not recommended and the default is `false`.

```yml
serviceproviders:
  allow_unknown: true
```

The metadata of the IdentityProvider (currently we don't allow more then one and assume that a possible WAYF is the
responsibility of the actual IdentityProvider proxied by eduProxy) must be provided in the ```application.yml```

```yml
idp:
# metadata_url: https://engine.surfconext.nl/authentication/idp/metadata
  metadata_url: classpath:saml/eb.idp.metadata.xml
```

## [Testing](#testing)
There are integration tests that spin off a running application and these can also be run inside the IDE.

There is a test SP endpoint that requires authentication against the configured IdP and displays all SAML attributes received:

[http://localhost:8080/test](http://localhost:8080/test)

The production SAML flow with a eduProxy is depicted in [this image](src/main/resources/static/images/eduproxy.001.jpeg).

## [Private signing key and public certificate](#signing-keys)

The SAML Spring Security library needs a private DSA key / public certificate pair for the eduProxy IdP / SP which can be generated.

```bash
openssl req -subj '/O=Organization, CN=EduProxy/' -newkey rsa:2048 -new -x509 -days 3652 -nodes -out eduproxy.crt -keyout eduproxy.pem
```

The Java KeyStore expects a pkcs8 DER format for RSA private keys so we have to re-format that key:

```bash
openssl pkcs8 -nocrypt  -in eduproxy.pem -topk8 -out eduproxy.der
```
 
Remove the whitespace, heading and footer from the eduproxy.crt and eduproxy.der:

```bash
cat eduproxy.der |head -n -1 |tail -n +2 | tr -d '\n'; echo
cat eduproxy.crt |head -n -1 |tail -n +2 | tr -d '\n'; echo
```

Above commands work on linux distributions. On mac you can issue the same command with `ghead` after you install `coreutils`:

```bash
brew install coreutils

cat eduproxy.der |ghead -n -1 |tail -n +2 | tr -d '\n'; echo
cat eduproxy.crt |ghead -n -1 |tail -n +2 | tr -d '\n'; echo
```

Add the eduproxy key pair to the application.yml file:

```yml
# eduProxy
proxy:
  private_key: ${output from cleaning the der file}
  certificate: ${output from cleaning the crt file}
```

## [Deployment](#deployment)
The eduProxy application has documented [properties](src/main/resources/application.yml) packaged inside the jar. When deploying
to a non-local environment ensure you have application.yml properties outside of the packaged jar to override
the eduProxy configuration.
