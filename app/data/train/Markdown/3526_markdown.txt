uid: SolidEdgeAssembly.AssemblyFilletWeld.Faces(SolidEdgeGeometry.FeatureTopologyQueryTypeConstants)
summary: Returns a collection of faces of a specified type that belong to a model, a feature, or a topology object.  The result of the Faces property is a topology collection. This topology collection is a temporary collection and is overwritten the next time the Edges, Faces, or FacesByRay property is used.
remarks: By default, the Faces property returns all faces for the object. The topology collection can be restricted to a specified type of face by supplying a value (from the FeatureTopologyQueryTypeConstants constant set) for the FaceType argument for the feature objects only. For example, this property can be set to return all faces that are spheres.
