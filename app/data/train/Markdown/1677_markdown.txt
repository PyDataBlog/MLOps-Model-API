# Deploy a First Micro Stack App

The second hack is meant to get you familiar with the architecture of apps built with the Monkey.Robotics Micro Stack framework.

## Steps

 1. Read the [Getting Started with the Micro Stack Framework Overview](../../Getting%20Started/Micro_Stack) to get an idea of how the architecture of the Micro Stack Framework works.
 2. Build and Deploy the [ButtonPush](ButtonPush.zip) app. The ButtonPush app illustrates the Reactive architecture by linking the Netduino’s onboard button to the onboard LED, so that when you push the button, the LED lights up. It’s a very simple application but illustrates how powerful the Micro Stack is.
