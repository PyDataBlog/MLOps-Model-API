## Start of Class

0. Remind students that we do not have class on MLK day
1. Remind students of the assignment that will be due
2. Alert students that there is a guest speaker tonight -- a web developer
3. Mention to students that class will keep ramping up
4. Be sure to tell students to regularly check in with your teaching fellow -- even outside of class
