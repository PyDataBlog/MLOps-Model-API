### An Angular Query Builder

---

**DEMO:** [https://jmaronge.github.io/angular-query-builder](https://jmaronge.github.io/angular-query-builder)

+ All that is needed to use this in your Angular 2 application is to copy the query-builder folder and import the QueryBuilderModule.


+ Very few styling has been added.  Since this is going to be used as part of a larger component I figured you would have your own styling to apply to it.
