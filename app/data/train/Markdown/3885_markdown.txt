Practice 2: Averaging Numbers in a File
=======================================

Create a folder on your hard drive called "practices". In that folder, create a text document (using notepad) called "numbers.txt". In that file put about 10 integers, one per line, like the following:

```
8
67
53
9
18
32
108
12
```

Save the file.

Create a Windows Console Application that reads the lines from the file and then displays the average of all the numbers on the screen.
