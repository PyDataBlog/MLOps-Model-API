# calendar.py
> A small (and personal) script for managing a Markdown calendar via terminal and Chrome.

You might be wondering "why this, what's this crap?"

Since I use my laptop a **lot** and my phone is just for calls and texting I
developed this very basic script for my needs.

## Requirements

Sorry if it's too restrictive, but as I said it's just a personal script. However
tweak it as you want!

- Google Chrome
- Google Chrome extension: Markdown Preview Plus

## Install

- Download the script
- Put it in a directory included in `PATH`
- `chmod u+x calendar.py`
- Enjoy!

## Usage

```sh
$ cd /path/to/my-calendar
$ calendar.py -i
$ ... (you can exit from the current directory)
$ calendar.py -c tomorrow # Create a "tasks" file for tomorrow
$ calendar.py -e tomorrow # Edit the file for tomorrow
$ calendar.py -s main # Open the browser to see your agenda
```

## Options
