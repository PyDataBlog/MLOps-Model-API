# webpack-doodle - Doodle with Webpack to study the bundler.

# Introduction
after checking out the webpack's documentation for quick Getting Started guide, and reading around I am able to do a basic configuration though I still feel that I would not know if using it correctly in a real project.

The intention behind this repo is to explore the bundler by applying it in an POC (proof of concept) and see where it goes.

Any comment that improves the code quality or app structure is welcome.
