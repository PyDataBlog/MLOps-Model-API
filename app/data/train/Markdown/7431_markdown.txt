Hi there.

I'm Alex (aka tinnvec) and I'm a nerd with a passion for coding starting in the mid-90s.

Currently, I use a lot of C# and .NET at work but tend to prefer JavaScript and Ruby for personal projects. Though I have my favorites, I'm always learning new things I find interesting (this site is done in Jekyll, for example).
