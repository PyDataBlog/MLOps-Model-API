# piconf
##Before we begin:
* This is my first project using Git & GitHub
* My first complex C project
* First attempt at a autotools project
* My Main languages are Java, JScript, Python & BASIC
* It will contain stupid / beginners mistakes & bad smelling
* The proof on concept was written in python but C has been choosen for the rewrite for preformance perticularly startup times

##Graphical Raspberry Pi settings
###What about raspi-config?
raspi-config is a text based script that isnt all to user friendly, pi-conf uses a Gtk3 UI but it is / will be used as the backend for many features
###Hang on isnt that rc_gui?
No. rc_gui is a dialog for accessing raspi-config featues but still isnt great in its friendless and only has limited funtionality leaving you needing other utilities such a pipanel with yet another incosistant UI
###So what is it?
pi-conf aims to replace the likes of:
* ru_gui
* pipanel
* alacarte

with one consistant easy to use extendable application.
####What do you mean extendable
as in Window Control Panel where that new hardware you added conviniently adds its little icon so anyone can add a page for the app or addon for the pi
giving you on centeral configuration platform.

###How can i use it?
piconf is in the early stages but to give it a go grab a copy of this repo open a termnal in the projects roor and enter `autoreconf && ./configure && make all && sudo make install && pi-conf` although you may have to install `libgtk-3-dev` first.
