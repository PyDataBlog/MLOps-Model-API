# Terminal-Trivia
Play trivia in the command-line.

To play, download the Terminal-Trivia folder and run the `terminal_trivia.py` program as you would normally run a Python program.

You can also enable "GIF-mode," which opens a Parks and Rec GIF in your webbrowser after the end of the game:

`python terminal_trivia.py --gif`
