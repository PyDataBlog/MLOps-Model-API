This was true, however recently I got an email about IAP I made from my sons iPad. Clicking through the "Report a problem" link in the email and logging in with my family organiser Apple ID shows this new message.

> Family Organisers can now review purchases charged to their shared
payment method, and they can submit refund requests on behalf of family
members. Family Organisers will be able to view purchases and manage
requests as long as a member is part of their family group.

This is one of those changes which makes you realise it should've worked like this from the start.
