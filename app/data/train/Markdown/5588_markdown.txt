Struggling to prioritize your wellness without breaking the bank? Maintaining healthy habits can feel time-consuming and expensive! Keeping up with the latest matcha or boutique fitness craze is a full-time job in itself. Join us at Money Circle if you want to step out of overwhelm and into simple actions that create lasting impact. This month, we'll be joined by Holistic Health Coach Megan Sanchez.

Megan’s workshop is designed to help you identify and prioritize the habits that make a difference in your unique lifestyle. Together, we’ll get clear on the baselines of health and wellness that are natural, affordable and easy to maintain in the long run.

You’ll learn:

* How to listen to your body and respond to what it’s telling you.

* How to get honest with yourself around a weekly wellness plan that allows you to save on money and time.

* What a seed habit is and how it can help you remain in control of your week (no matter how full your life is!)

* Tips and tricks to stretch your money further on groceries, workouts and more!

Megan Sanchez is a Holistic Health Coach and the founder of [UpSwing Health Coaching](https://upswinghealthcoaching.com/). Megan works with high-level executives, busy professionals and working parents who are stretched thin and exhausted from prioritizing everything and everyone else above their own health and wellness.

By embracing a new mindset and mastering slow, easy to manage habit change, Megan supports people who are excited to take inspired action, setting healthy boundaries so they can feel vibrant and alive in everything they venture to do.

UpSwing believes that every individual has a unique definition of wellness and will stop at nothing to challenge and change the grind–crash–repeat culture of our professional and personal lives.

Megan loves both outdoor and urban adventures. She lives with her husband and has called DC home for almost 8 years.
