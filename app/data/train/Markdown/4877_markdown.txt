title: Edit Encrypted Files Quickly
---

I wrote a little script to make it easier to edit encrypted files.
Would be happy about any help to improve this script.<!--more-->


I like to store my secrets in encrypted files instead of using some third party service.

The _best_ encryption I found so far is AES 256 using openssl.
But it's difficult to remember the openssl commands. And it's even more tricky to change something in an encrypted file.

That's why I wrote a [script](https://github.com/jorinvo/encedit/blob/master/encedit) to help me with that.


Unfortunately I'm not a security expert and I might have missed something important here.
I'm more than happy about any feedback! And maybe this script is also useful to someone else.
