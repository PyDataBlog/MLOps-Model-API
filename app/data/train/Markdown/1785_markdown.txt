### What value does Drift Daily bring?

Drift Daily helps you learn more about your new leads, subscribers, and customers via email and slack. It shows you all of your new contacts from the previous day, with VIPs at the top. It provides a rich profile for each new contact including LinkedIn & Twitter profiles, as well as company information. Rather than logging into your CRM to get emails and then have to go digging for this information, we serve it right up to your email. This lets your team get right on the phone to follow-up, rather than have to do this digging themselves.

<div id="signed-up"></div>
##### What does “Signed up” mean? How do I know if a new contact is from a manual entry vs. a form fill?

Right now we can’t discern between a sales representative manually entering a new contact, and a prospect who came to your site and filled out a form. In the future, we plan on giving you more information, when possible, about the source of the contact.

<div id="differentiation"></div>
##### What does Drift Daily do that my other system doesn’t?

Today, you have to log into your system(s), scan a list of new contacts, and even then you only see names. Drift Daily comes straight to your email, and provides a rich profile for each new contact based on LinkedIn and Twitter profiles, as well as company information. It helps you get to know your contacts as people so you and your reps are ready to pick up the phone and call, instead of go digging to find that information first.

<div id="integrations"></div>
##### How do integrations work?

After you connect your account, we monitor any time a new contact is added into the database. Whenever one is, we grab their data from the system you connected it to and enrich it with our own data. 

<div id="slack"></div>
##### How does the Slack integration work?

If you want real-time updates each time you get a new lead, you’ll want to integrate with Slack. Once you authorize Drift Daily to work with Slack, you’ll be asked to choose a #room to display your new leads. Each time a new contact is collected, we’ll post that person’s information, along with their company information, right in that slack channel.

<div id="security"></div>
##### How are you handling my data? How do I know my contact database is secure?

For all of our integrations, we’re using the authentication process that each company provides, which creates the most secure connection between Drift and your data. At anytime, for any reason at all, you can go into your application and revoke Drift’s access.

If you’d like to learn more about how we use industry best practices at Drift, [you can do so here](http://help.driftt.com/security/).

<div id="api"></div>
##### Is there an API we can access to get the data and modify the presentation for our needs?

We do have a Zapier integration, which you could use to pipe the data from Drift into hundreds of other applications. If you’d like to get setup with this, send us a note at hello@drift.com

In the future we plan to add an API. Please send us an email at hello@drift.com if you'd like to be notified when it's ready.

We are also adding support for Segment and Zapier. 

<div id="routing"></div>
##### Is there a way to route specific new contacts to specific sales reps?

Right now Drift Daily sends all contacts to all users who are subscribed. We’d love to learn more about how exactly you’d like to customize these notifications, so please reach out to us at hello@drift.com

<div id="syncing"></div>
##### If I interact with customer data in Drift Daily, will that sync and modify records in my CRM?

Not today but we plan on adding that support in the future. Please reach out to us at hello@drift.com if you’d like to be the first to know when it’s ready.
