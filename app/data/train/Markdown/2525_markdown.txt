# Scripts


## als

Compares the magnitudes in two `als` files.


## apass

Reads a given photometry file (.als, .mag, .obs, .dat) and compares it with
the photometry obtained from APASS. Creates the `apass_compare.png` image.


## aperphot

Compares the magnitude and magnitude error of the `phot` task versus photutils.


## als_2_txt

Convert `.als.1` files to the `.txt` files necessary to feed `DAOMASTER`.


## daom_obs_prep

Checks the star density in each .mag file output by DAOMASTER, and generates
the `daom.obs` file by adding the airmass columns to the `daom.raw` file
selected. Creates the `daomaster_wt_X.png` images.


## final_phot

Takes the `daom.obs` and `fit_coeffs.dat` files and generates the calibrated
photometry using the magnitude values from DAOM and the transformation
equations (and coefficients) obtained with Python. It creates the
`final_phot.dat` final photometry and the `final_phot.png` image.


## phot_compare

Compares the final photometry obtained with IRAF using the `invertfit` task,
with the Python photometry generated by the `final_phot` script.
Creates the `phot_compare.png` file.


## psf

Compares the (aperture corrected) magnitudes in a `als` file (IRAF) with the
magnitudes obtained with the Python scripts.
