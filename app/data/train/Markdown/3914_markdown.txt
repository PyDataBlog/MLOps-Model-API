    <td>My learning was limited as we didn't have much time to code as we started looking at blogs quite soon in the lesson. I think that I need to work on remembering what the exact words are to do something that I want.</td>

    <td>I will try and drill the commands into my brain and improve my blog. Also I will improve my learning by reading through the question and instructions thoroughly.</td>
