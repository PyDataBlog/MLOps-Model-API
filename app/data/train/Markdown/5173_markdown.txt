Happy Friday! Here’s what I was up to this past week.

## **How I Earned Money This Week**

* A new client paid for her first month of coaching.

* Dan's bi-weekly paycheck came through.

* We had one Airbnb guest earlier this week.

## **How I Spent Money This Week**

* Well, Dan and I bought a car! We went back to Subaru on Saturday to see what cars that actually had in stock and we ended up making a decision that day. After a bunch of haggling, we decided to trade in Dan's 12-year-old Kia Spectra and drive home a new Subaru Crosstrek! I'm excited to have a car that I can actually drive, though I'm going to have to practice a lot before I feel comfortable driving on my own. We actually paid for the car in cash, so that was a huge purchase for us. It was stressful to write a check that big, but I'm glad we won't have a car payment!

* We hired someone to do our taxes this year, and we owed Maryland a large sum of money. I paid the bill through Maryland's online tax portal. Luckily, we'd saved enough to cover the amount. Plus, we got a Federal refund, so we actually saved too much money for taxes!

* Dan put a bunch of work travel spending on our joint credit card. Luckily, we'll get reimbursed by the end of the month. Plus, we're able to collect the points!

* The April Money Circle meetup on balancing health and budget was this week! We had a wonderful time with Megan Sanchez of [Upswing Health Coaching](https://upswinghealthcoaching.com/). Before the event, I bought snacks and wine from Trader Joe's.

## **What I’m Writing**

I've written before about how to save up for emergencies, but this month, I wrote about how to [keep your own hands off](https://www.maggiegermano.com/blog/how-to-keep-your-hands-off-your-emergency-savings/) your emergency fund.

## **What I’m Up To**

* My friend and real estate agent, [Liz Ho](https://www.rlahre.com/agent/liz-ho/), and I are hosting a buyer’s salon in DC on Wednesday, April 24th. [Join us for this free event!](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/what-does-it-financially-take-to-buy-a-home-a-buyers-salon-tickets-59796021510)

* I was quoted in [OppLoans](https://www.opploans.com/blog/financial-basics-how-to-use-credit-responsibly/) about how to use credit responsibly.

## **What I’m Excited About**

Dan and I are heading up to Syracuse tonight! This Sunday is Easter and we always spend Easter with my family. It will be Bruno's first road trip since we brought him home, and the first time he gets to meet my niece and nephew!

## **What I’m Reading**

I’m still reading ***[Sweet Little Lies](https://www.amazon.com/Sweet-Little-Lies-Caz-Frear/dp/0062823191)*** by Caz Frear. It's starting to get exciting!
