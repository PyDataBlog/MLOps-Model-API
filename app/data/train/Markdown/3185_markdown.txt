Clone, contribute, create a pull request, and nudge philadams to review it. Do remember to add yourself to `CONTRIBUTORS.md`.

Work gets a bit crazy at times, so there might be a short wait, but I'll get to
your PR as soon as possible! Thank you for your interest in the project and for
contributing your time.
