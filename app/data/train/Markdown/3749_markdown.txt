# What?
Yes, a graphing calculator for a credit-card-sized device. Fully functioning graphing, tables, and function editing! (unfortunately with presets)

# Why?
I just to see if I could squeeze my graphing program into less than 32KB. At first, it seemed impossible, but then I found out I could just combine some unused arrays and I got 10% of my memory back.

# How to install
Download the .arduboy and use a program like Arduboy Manager!

If you want to change the source code, just download the .ino file and open it in the Arduino IDE.

# Controls
* *Up and Down*: move cursor
* *Left and Right*: decrease/increase selected variable
* *A*: Go back to the graph screen

**B depends on the current screen.**

* *B while on graph and function screens*: confirm
* *B while on function variable, window, and table screens*: switch between adding 1 and adding 0.1
* *B while on the "Oh no!" screen*: escape
