NewTrans
========

Translation plugin for the Bukkit server software of Minecraft.

There is a full description of the plugin on the DevBukkit page: http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/newtrans/

If you would like to contribute fork the project and make a pull request after making your changes. I will check them over and determine if they're suitable to be added, and if I find them suitable I'll add them in the next build of the plugin I release.

In your pull request make clear what you are adding or editing in the description.

1.6/1.7  compatibility:
2015-02-25: "Compressed" changes with Minecraft version detection. The plugin should automatically decide whether to use UUIDs or Usernames when writing to playerLangs.dat, and the file no longer needs deletion when you update the server. NOTE: You MUST delete the playerLangs.dat file BEFORE updating to ANY release above 1.3.0.

Testing: I test the plugin quite a few times before putting it up here. Noted below are the different Bukkit/Cauldron versions I use for testing.
1.6.4 Bukkit: craftbukkit-1.6.4-R2.0.jar
1.7.2 Bukkit: craftbukkit-1.7.2-R0.3.jar
1.7.2 Cauldron: cauldron-1.7.2-1.1147.04.181-server.jar
1.8.0 Bukkit: craftbukkit-1.8-R0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

If you make changes and test these with a different jar make sure to mention it if you want me to implement those changes into the plugin.

Thanks.
