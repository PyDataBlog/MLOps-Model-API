# Training
* Make sure you've created datasets like [here](https://github.com/TengdaHan/Convolutional_Sketch_Inversion/tree/master/src/data), and load them correctly in [train.py](https://github.com/TengdaHan/Convolutional_Sketch_Inversion/blob/master/src/train.py)
* Run in terminal: `python train.py`
