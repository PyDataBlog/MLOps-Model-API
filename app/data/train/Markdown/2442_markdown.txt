<p>This application will not root your device but serves as a tool to verify your root access. When you run the application if you get a check mark this means you have root access and if you get an 'X' you do not. I can not guarantee that the application will be 100% accurate.
I have tested it on the following devices with success:</p>
<ul>
<li>Samsung Galaxy S3 (rooted)</li>
<li>Samsung Galaxy S3 (unrooted)</li>
<li>Nexus 7 (rooted)</li>
<li>Nexus 7 (unrooted)</li>
<li>Samsung Galaxy S2 (rooted)</li>
<li>Samsung Captivate (unrooted)</li>
<li>Sony Xperia Arc (rooted)</li>
<li>Motorola Xoom (Rooted)</li>
<li>MK802 II (unrooted)</li>
<li>Bluestacks Emulator (unrooted)</li>
</ul>

I would also like to thank Grandel Cuvos as my offical beta tester!</p>
