According to Rev. 1:1 the title of the book is "The Revelation of Jesus Christ". It is a self-revelation of Him to His people and an expression of His care for them.

The book is the unveiling of Jesus Christ and it is both from Jesus and about Him. He is the focus of its content and its central figure.

It begins where the four Gospels end, with Jesus's resurrection and ascension into heaven and the continuation of his work of salvation.

Together with the Epistle to the Hebrews, Revelation emphasizes Jesus' heavenly ministry. Without Revelation or Hebrews, our knowledge of Christ's high-priestly ministry in heaven in behalf of His people would be very limited.
