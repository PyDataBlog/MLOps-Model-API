## Bugs

### Where to Find Known Issues

We will be using GitHub Issues for our public bugs. We will keep a close eye on this and try to make it clear when we have an internal fix in progress. Before filing a new task, try to make sure your problem doesn't already exist.

### Reporting New Issues

Please ensure your bug description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue. The best way is to provide a reduced test case on jsFiddle or jsBin.
