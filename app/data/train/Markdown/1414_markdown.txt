# Crafting

-   Rethink of Crafting Ideas....
-   It takes a village to craft an item.
-   Crafting will no longer be something every player has several types of on each character – making alts to max it out on each.
-   Crafting will be done at a guild / tribe level.
-   Players provide mats to NPCs who can craft items for them.
-   Crafted items take a non-trivial amount of time to produce.
-   Making 20 of an item and vending it is the opposite of what we want.
-   Recipes will be very hard to come by.
-   Crafted items will rely on 'tech level' and factors like which materials are available and who can 'remember' how to 'card wool' / 'spin yarn' etc.

## Resources

-   Basic resource nodes should be plentiful and respawn at frequent intervals.
-   It should be enjoyable to harvest them.
-   A freshly made char should be able to access all areas and harvest all nodes.
-   Your harvesting skill should in part determine what you harvest e.g. lvl 1 gets only white resources, lvl 2 some white occasional greens, lvl 3 greens mostly some blues, etc
-   Short-term buffs ala Tera
-   Harvest time of day, cycle of moon and other factors affect what you are harvesting to some degree

## Crafting
-   Only the most base recipes are learnt at first
-   You don't need to craft things to lvl up i.e. 10 x robe of vending to prevent vast waste of mats and time / money
-   Recipes are learnt from a trainer or another player...you trade money and potentially mats / etc in order to learn the recipe. You can teach that recipe to others once you've made it x number of times. The further down the chain of learning you are the more times you need to make it to perfect the recipe. You cannot charge any more than half of what you paid to learn the recipe when teaching it to others – making a shiny pyramid.
-   A recipe can be taught no end of times – the pyramid can be very wide, but limited in depth eventually by value recouped on teaching it – and selling items from it
-   Recipes are viral – and very very rarely ever drop making them one of the most important resources on a server to control.
-   City armour, and armour specific to regions / bosses
-   New recipes can be discovered or possibly formulated e.g. new armour created based on a piece of armour, a bunch of mats, gems, etc. This might be the same model as the base armour or one of many specialisations e.g. more ornate detail on the front, a fur collar, a special effect (maybe)
-   Craft mats can be used from any storage you have, starting with your bags, then your bank
-   Consider crafting failure, creating a lesser item
-   You can learn all the crafts and all harvesting

## Harvesting

Nodes will be of a few basic types.

-   Crystals
-   Ore
-   Plants
-   Leather drops from animals / teeth / claws / sinew / etc
-   Wood – or buy this from lumber mills?
-   Highly rare mats like oil, sulfur, guano, unguents...bark, mushrooms, moss, etc? Weird spawn times, midnight for some items, blood moon, waxing moon...

What you harvest will be limited by both the quality of the node and your resource skill. Spread nodes of all quality over all the regions...I want regions to feel free, so you can herb in your favorite zone...you might not get mushrooms in a desert, but you shouldn't get only lvl 15 stuff because you don't like the lvl 60 regions.

## Mob Drops

Bosses and mobs don't drop armour, at least not anything worth wearing, though some might be good for prototyping other armour on...white lvl armour with a good look.
Drops will usually be rare mats for crafting, gold, potions / consumables, very very rarely a recipe,

## Customisation
Armour can be re-worked to look like any other armour in it's class i.e. leather made to look like other leather
Armour can be customised with colour

-   Enchants. Just another layer of bullshit on top? Every mage ended up with basically the same enchants, same with DPS warriors and prot warriors.
-   Gems. Same shit as enchants or worth thinking over?
-   Reforge. Same shit as enchants?
-   3 different systems to tweak your armour – seems better to handle via one system that is far more flexible – but give them a small ability to tweak it. These seem more like cheap ways to drain cash out the economy...think of a better way.
