Cory started working with the internet way back in 2001 when she chanced her way into a position as web content editor for the Aussie version of the X-Games. Since then she's dabbled in PR, marketing, events management, a skateboard shop, worked as a barista, accrued a blank IMDB profile, run pub poker tournaments in rural NSW, and dropped out of Bible college - amongst other things. Cory recently returned to Melbourne from Dublin, where she managed design teams at Paddy Power and Mobile Travel Technologies. Sheâ€™s currently working as a UX Lead at ANZ.
