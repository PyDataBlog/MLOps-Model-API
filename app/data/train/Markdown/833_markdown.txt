Getting stuff done - more vapourware, this time with shiny new tech

## TL;DR
Playing around with shiny new tech by creating a web app for following the [Getting Things Done](https://hamberg.no/gtd/) organisational framework.

## What's this all about?
I want to play with a whole bunch of shiny(ish), new(ish) tech and methodologies.  I intend to do this by building a vapourware web app to help follow the [Getting Things Done](https://hamberg.no/gtd/) organisational framework.
To this end this project will hopefully/kinda/sorta do some of the following:

 * Built using Clojure
 * Use BDD to specify the application using plain English
    * Cucumber
 * Property based testing
    * test.check
 * Use mobile first, responsive web design
    * Isomorphic web app using Om Next and the Nashorn javascript engine
 * Continuous deployment
