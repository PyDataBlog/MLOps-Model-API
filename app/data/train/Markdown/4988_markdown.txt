Today we are happy to announce that our **Git Ninja Class** is coming to Istanbul!

At thoughtram we are commited to run workshops online and offline. Every once in a while we try to bring our offline workshops to a new city. Yes, we love chats and hangouts as well but we also value being physically in one room together. 

Istanbul is the largest city in Turkey with a vibrant tech scene. We are happy to have a strong partner in Istanbul to support us with all local affairs.

The workshop will be held on **13th + 14th of September 2014**.
