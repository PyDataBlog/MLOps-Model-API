kano-init-flow
==============

This package is a walkthrough of the process of setting up Kano OS for the first time. It is designed to guide the user through the setup process including:

* Configuring their hardware setup (display and audio settings for example)
* Configuring the software preferences (like the wallpaper)
* Teaching them how to use their Kano keyboard
* Setting up their profile for use on the kit (create or log in to an existent Kano Profile)
