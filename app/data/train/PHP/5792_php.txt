Karma is a set of patches to access point software to get it to respond to probe requests not just for itself but for any ESSID requested. This allows the AP to act as a lure to draw in any clients probing for known networks.

The original Karma patches were released by Dino Dia Zovi for Madwifi, I then took over and ported the patches to Madwifi-ng and have now taken them to the new hostapd. (Robin @digininja)
