# Run checkpatch script for coding guidelines

# param : top level directory of the project
#
# Disabled options are :
#    * CONST_STRUCT : as no structure *MUST* be used as const
#    * INITIALISED_STATIC : let me initialize my static variable.
#    * SPACING : because "if (! var)" is better than "if (!var)"
#    * GLOBAL_INITIALISERS : same as INITIALISED_STATIC
#    * NEW_TYPEDEFS : typedef are used to obsfuscate struct internals to user
#    * USE_FUNC : __func__ is use on Windows, which leads to a false positive
#
# This script should be run from the root of the repository
