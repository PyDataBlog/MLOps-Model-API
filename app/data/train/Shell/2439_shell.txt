WEATHER CONDITIONS (must be personalised)



curl --silent "http://weather.yahooapis.com/forecastrss?p=CAXX0236&u=c" | grep -E '(Current Conditions:|C<BR)' | tail -n1 | sed -e 's///' -e 's/ C$/ËšC/'



Refresh Rate: 600





Simply replace



CAXX0236&u=c



with your own city's address





***The final letter c in "CAXX0236&u=c" refers to celsius, so replacing it to the letter"f" makes it fahrenheit



HOW TO:

- go to : weather.yahoo.com/

- find your city's weather page by searching it

- click on the rss feed button (it's orange and says RSS...)

- the last part of the webpage's address is what you need to replace my own code above
