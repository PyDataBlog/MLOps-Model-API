  [ROLES]
  Roles represent the different possible jobs, classes, etc. available to your
  players. Each role can have different base statistics, growth rates,
  spellbooks, and skillsets.

  --DETAILS--

  * name
    Represents the role's name, and how it is referred to in-game

  * description
    How the role is described in flavor text

  * level_cap
    The maximum level this role can reach

  * hp, mp
    The level 1 values for this class' health and mana pools

  * hp_growth, mp_growth
    The modifiers that increase health and mana every levelup. The default in
    actors.lua for the formula is:
      base pool + ((base pool * base pool growth) * (level - 1))

  * str, int, dex, con
    The initial values for each of the base statistics. These do not grow
    automatically like health or mana, but instead are raised manually by the
    player with stat points.

  * exp_to_2
    The amount of experience that would be needed to reach level 2. This is
    used in algorithms to determine exp to next level

  * exp_modifier
    Used with exp_to_2 and the character's level to determine the exp needed
    to reach the next level

  * pts_per_lv
    The amount of stat points the character obtains every level that can
    be spent raising statistics.

  * spellbooks
    Table of spellbooks available to this role. This role will have access to
    all spells in these spellbooks of their current spell level, unless they are
    one of the spell's restricted roles.

  * spell_lv_table
    Table that represents a role's spell level at a given character level.
    Characters can only cast spells at a level at or below their spell level,
    and this also modifies their competency with spells in general. Make sure
    that this table is as long as the role's level cap.

  * skillsets
    Table of skillsets available to this role. This role will be able to use
    any skills in these skillsets of their current skill level, unless they are
    one of the skill's restricted roles.

  * skill_lv_table
    Table that represents a role's skill level at a given character level.
    Characters can only use skills at a level at or below their skill level,
    and this also modifies their competency with skills in general. Make sure
    that this table is as long as the role's level cap.

  * special
    Boolean flag that represents whether this role is restricted during
    character creation. Useful for "prestige" roles, or those you want to be
    unique to a character.
