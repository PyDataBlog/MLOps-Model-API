>19.94. Chapter 94</H1
><P
>1. O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.</P
><P
>2. Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud.</P
><P
>3. LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?</P
><P
>4. How long shall they utter and speak hard things?  and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?</P
><P
>5. They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage.</P
><P
>6. They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.</P
><P
>7. Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.</P
><P
>8. Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye be wise?</P
><P
>9. He that planted the ear, shall he not hear?  he that formed the eye, shall he not see?</P
><P
>10. He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct?  he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?</P
><P
>11. The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.</P
><P
>12. Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law;</P
><P
>13. That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked.</P
><P
>14. For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.</P
><P
>15. But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it.</P
><P
>16. Who will rise up for me against the evildoers?  or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?</P
><P
>17. Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence.</P
><P
>18. When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.</P
><P
>19. In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul.</P
><P
>20. Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?</P
><P
>21. They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.</P
><P
>22. But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge.</P
><P
>23. And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall cut them off.</P
