<a href="http://txt2re.com/">[Link]</a><br />A pretty awesome page to help when creating regular expressions. &nbsp;Type in the string you want to match, then use the selectors to create a snippet of code with the regex and validation process pre-populated, allowing you to drop the code straight into your application. (full credit to <a href="https://twitter.com/zoe_nolan">Zoe Nolan</a> for the link!)<br /><br />This is a cracking starting point for some simple regex work (or when your head just isn't wrapping itself around the joys of regex), but for more detailed help, pointers and tips I'd suggest taking a look at the following: <br /><ul><li><a href="http://regexlib.com/">Regex Library</a></li><li><a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/">Regular Expressions Info</a></li></ul>
