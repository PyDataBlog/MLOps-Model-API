summary: States and localities across the United States have implemented overdose fatality review teams to address the impact of the opioid crisis on their communities. Overdose fatality review teams are designed to increase cross-system collaboration among various public safety, public health, and social service agencies; identify missed opportunities and system gaps; and develop recommendations for intervention efforts in hopes of preventing future overdose deaths. However, limitations in peer-reviewed research on the effectiveness of overdose fatality review teams limit the understanding of their usefulness. This article provides a review of literature on overdose fatality review teams, including goals, recommendations, and information sharing protocols, as well as considerations from other fatality review teams.
