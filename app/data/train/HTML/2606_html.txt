									<h2 class="headStuff">How to trade:</h2>
										<p class="sit">	
													In order to initiate a trade you need to be logged into the Steam Community and connected to Steam Friends.
1. Open your Friends list, located in the lower right hand corner of the Steam client
2. Click on the small arrow next to the friend you wish to invite to Trade and click on Invite to Trade
Alternatively, if you are chatting with your friend you can start a trade from the chat window by clicking on the large arrow and selecting Invite to Trade:
<!--Insert tutorial here-->
								<img src="Resources/images/dow.jpg"/>
								<p class="sit">	3. Once accepted the trade window will appear where you can view your items, games, and coupons available to trade.
4. Select the appropriate backpack you wish to view from the dropdown menu on the left
5. Click and drag the item, game, or coupon you wish to trade from your backpack to your trade window. If you wish to remove an item, game, or coupon simply drag it back to your backpack from the trade window.
6. Click on Ready to Trade and wait for the other party to click on Ready to Trade.
7. Verify the contents of the trade are correct by hovering your mouse over each item and reading the item details.
8. Click on Make Trade - Once you click this button the trade cannot be undone!
9. The trade will finish processing and you will receive a confirmation window with what items, games, or coupons you received in the trade
								<p class="sit">
								Any game you've purchased from the store as a gift, or received as an Extra Copy, can be traded to other users 30 days after their original purchase. They can be used to trade for other Gifts, or for items in games supporting Steam Trading. If you would like to purchase a gift and save it to send it as a gift or use it in a Steam trade at a later time, please choose 'Store the gift in my inventory to send later' when checking out.
								<p class="sit">
								Steam restricts all gifts from being used in a Steam trade for 30 days after their original purchase date. However, you can still use the 'Send A Gift' feature to send this game to a friend at any time. Some gifts are also restricted to the territory that they are purchased in. This is noted on the gift itself when viewing it.
 
Does Steam Trading mean I can sell my used games?
No, only games that have been bought as a gift, and thus have never been played, can be traded. Once the Steam Gift is opened and added to your game library, you wonâ€™t be able to trade it again.
 
How do I see my Inventory on the Steam Community?
From your username drop down in the top Steam menu, select Inventory. You can also find a link from your profile.
								<p class="sit">Your Inventory privacy settings can be found in your Inventory, they are similar to the Profile privacy settings - public, friends only, friends of friends, or private.
 
Who can I trade with?
You can initiate a trade with anyone in a Group Chat or on your Friends List.
 
How is this different from trading in Team Fortress 2?
We've improved the display of changing which items are in the trade, and significantly increased the number of items that can be traded in one session. We hope these improvements will help with confusion or users trying to deceive others in the trade.
 
I have ideas for other things in Steam that can be traded. How do I give that feedback?
You can post feedback or suggestions in our Suggestions/Ideas forum as it is regularly read by the developers.
 
I think I just lost items in a trade! What do I do?
Please view the Steam Trading Policy for more information.
