	<h1>Welcome to free software development course</h1>
	<p>This course is intended to give you a quick overview to free software development using free tools. Currently only C Programming language is covered and may be extended in future versions of this course.</p>
	
	<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
	<p>In addition to start programming you may want to download and install common tools for c development. We will take extensive use of `gcc`. To ease programming I recommend you `make` and `gdb`, too. Use your editor of choice, preferably with syntax highlighting for the C language. Personally I prefer `emacs`.</p>
	<p>Be part of the fun!</p>
