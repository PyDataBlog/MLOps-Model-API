    <p data-a="hello ">Hello world how are you today?</p>
    <p>This is a test of the use of ligatures to encode icons in a fun and cool way. Now you can insert graphics just through very simple text edditing, kind of like having emoticons!</p>
    <p>Sadly ligs aren't supported in IE before version 10!</p>
    <p>We will also test the <span aria-hidden="true" data-icon="heroku"> </span> for the CSS :before and :after pseudo elements</p>
