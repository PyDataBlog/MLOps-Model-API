\section{Cautionary Tale on Filtering}
\label{filtering}

It is tempting to insert standard filtering techniques from signal processing 
after creating a Gaussian process model but prior to any dynamic time warping 
calculations. The temptation comes from the fact that DTW is a signal 
processing technique and so, hypothetically, using other well-known algorithms
before DTW would clean the signal and result in a smoother DTW comparison.
A fast Fourier transform (FFT) based low-pass filter 
\cite{merletti1999standards,moreland2003fft} or 
Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) \cite{muda2010voice,imai1983cepstral} 
could potentially be used to reduce error in the model itself, 
and thus make the contribution FOM more precise. Unfortunately, most 
fuel cycle metrics are not well-formed candidates for such filtering strategies.
Including such filters as part of the analysis can easily lead to wildly unphysical
models.

Consider a simple low-pass filter where a 256 channel real-valued FFT frequency 
transform is taken.  All but lowest 32 channels are discarded prior to the applying 
the inverse transform. This algorithm removes the
high frequency jitter in the original signal, and 
potentially allows for a better signal-to-noise ratio. Different values
for the number of total channels and the number of channels kept could be 
used to create alternative low-pass filters. These values represent the 
resolution of the transformation to and from the frequency domain. Keeping
only the coarsest eighth of the total number of channels should retain only
the general trends from the original time series.

\label{fft-lwr-model}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fft-lwr-model} shows the results of applying the low-pass filter 
described above to the Gaussian process model of the LWR generated power, 
$m_*^\LWR(t)$.  The filtered curve demonstrates at least three major problems.  The
first is that the values of the curve are allowed to be negative, which is 
impossible for this (and many other) fuel cycle metrics.  The second is that 
near the time boundaries ($t=2010$ and $t=2210$), the amplitude of the filtered model
is significantly higher than the unfiltered model. At $t=2210$, the metric 
should be zero but
instead is 36.5 GWe. This is because of the oscillations in the filter that 
begin around 2150 and grow in amplitude. These oscillations themselves 
come from the fact that the FFT is attempting to model a flat line as a sum
of only 32 sinusoidal basis functions. 
Thirdly, the shape of the curve itself is skewed to lower 
times. The time at which the metric goes to zero should be near year 2150 but is 
instead closer to year 2115.  All of these issues would severely distort any 
DTW calculations that follow.

The reason behind these inconsistencies is that the FFT process is fundamentally 
periodic.  However, using the annual time grid here, the LWR generated power metric
is not periodic. Neither is the modeling error for most fuel cycle metrics periodic
on an annual basis. 
Thus, while well-intentioned, a low-pass filter is not generally applicable.

Alternatively, MFCCs provide a mechanism for converting a time series into a 
set of power spectrum coefficient curves. In practice, many audio processing
libraries contain an out-of-the-box MFCC algorithm. For this paper, 
the MFCC implementation provided by the librosa package v0.4.1
\cite{mcfee2015librosa} was used.
Since the dynamic time warping procedure
uses an $L_1$ norm to form the cost matrix, the MFCCs of two signals can be directly 
compared. Each coefficient should roughly correspond in shape and amplitude to some
feature in the original signal.  Noisy, high frequency coefficients tend to be 
very similar and so their contribution to a DTW distance is correspondingly less 
than the contribution for lower mode coefficients. Coupling MFCC to DTW is an 
extremely common method employed in speech recognition systems 
\cite{muda2010voice,milner2002speech,sato2007emotion}.

significance.  The remaining, least-significant coefficients are visible
near the time axis.}
\label{mfcc-lwr-model}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{mfcc-lwr-model} displays the MFCC curves of the LWR Gaussian 
process model as well as the model itself. None of these curves, not even the 
major coefficient (MFCC 0), resembles the actual model.
As with the low-pass filter, the MFCCs also have 
uncharacteristic negative components.  Moreover, 
the metric data is not sampled frequently enough to have meaningful
time windows. For the fuel cycle metrics here, there is only one data point per year 
and the signal itself may change in a meaningful way each year. By comparison, 
in speech recognition, audio is sampled on the order of 22050 Hz 
\cite{EBUTECH3285,juang1991hidden}. 
The data volume for fuel cycle benchmark metrics
is simply too low for MFCC transformations to capture the desired features. 

Proceeding anyways, suppose the contribution measure is computed for the MFCCs 
of LWR, FR, and 
total generated power models.  In this case the LWR contribution is found to be 
0.572 while the FR contribution is 0.899. Using the models directly as was done 
in \S\ref{contribution}, the contribution values were 0.298 and 0.859 respectively.
This implies that using the MFCCs had the opposite effect as desired.  The MFCCs
added error to the FOM and made the LWR and FR contributions seem more alike 
than the analysis without such filtering indicated.

Therefore filtering the models prior to dynamic time warping is a dubious practice
in the general case. In all likelihood, the metric does not meet the underlying 
assumptions of the filter. The metric may not be periodic or may not be sampled 
frequently enough. Sometimes it may be possible to construct a metric that does
meet these qualifications. For instance, the generated power could be sampled monthly  
such that seasonal demand behavior is noticeable. Even in such a case, it is instead recommended
to pick a different kernel for the Gaussian process model such that these 
periodic behaviors are captured.  The regression itself then takes on the role of 
minimizing model uncertainty. Further filtering to this end becomes redundant and
dangerous.  Additionally, it is unlikely that 
the majority of the simulators would be able to calculate such a high-fidelity metric.
That alone should disqualify such metrics or FOMs from any benchmarking study or
inter-code comparison.
