\chapter{Play sheets}

Four sheets follow, free for use in your game:

\begin{itemize}
\item Character background sheet, similar to the Character Phases Worksheet from The Dresden Files.
\item A sheet for the information on a Cluster and its systems
\item A sheet for starships (in essence, another character at the table).
\item And a space combat sheet, for use in the space combat minigame.
\end{itemize}

Thanks to Big John (\url{http://rpggeek.com/user/vacavriach}) for creating these.
