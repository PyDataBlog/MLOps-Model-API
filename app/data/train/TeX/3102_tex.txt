\chapter*{Preface}

The analysis of data has become one of the more valuable aspects of most organization's toolkits. Analyzing data quickly and producing meaningful information from data in a relatively short amount of time is often of utmost importance, and yet it remains challenging to do so in many contexts. 

One of the major improvements in this realm is cluster computing, where an individual can run multiple analyses on different machines at the same time. However, 
many individuals who analyze data do so on a single computer, e.g. a personal laptop, even if they have access to cluster computing resources. This is often because these individuals have not yet been introduced to the skills and tools to make use of cluster computing resources. 

The goal of this document is to help individuals use Linux cluster computing resources in order to carry out data analyses in less time. The target audience is any individual who wishes to use cluster computing resources. Very little prior knowledge of computer science is assumed; this document attempts to clearly provide information from an introductory up to advanced levels in order to provide the tools and skills from which any individual may benefit.
