\section{Original Project Description}
This project will create an electronic market place that is immune to shutdown by governments, immune to lawyer-based attacks or other real-world threats. The proof-of-concept marketplace will have no central server bottleneck, no central point of trust, full self-organization and unbounded scalability.

To keep this project realistic, the focus will be on re-using existing code, support only Bitcoin-Euro trading, only use a single marketmaker, and offer no anonymity or DDoS protection. Bitcoin shows how vulnerable marketplaces are. Bitcoin was the first ever successful cybercurrency after decades of failures by  scientists, anarchists, fraudsters, and entrepreneurs. However, this first-generation technology suffers from an highly unstable exchange rate, low usage level and frequent large-scale thefts by hacking exchange platforms.
