\rulebox{Characters have three Stunts.}

Each character also selects three Stunts, from a list of general Stunt types. Players are expected to define what exactly their Stunt does based on the general rule for the type of Stunt they have selected.

There are four well-defined categories of stunts: military-grade, have a thing, skill substitution, and alter a track. There is also room to build your own stunts without reference to these categories, which we call ``free-form'' stunts.

% \begin{description}
\subsection{military-grade}

Apply to one Skill. Military-grade (MG for short) provides a qualitative difference to its Skill: it allows you to make rolls in circumstances where you would not be able to otherwise. For weapons and armour, the character can now use and have access to non-civilian weapons. For space Skills, the effect varies by system; see Space Combat (\autoref{cha:space-combat}).

For other Skills the player may have to invent the effect. The precise effects of a military-grade Stunt can vary from game to game and from character to character.

\subsection{have a thing}

The character has an important thing at his disposal. This might be a spaceship, property, or something else. Note that this does not help with monthly maintenance costs, and so a character with this Stunt who has taken a slipship may be assuming obligations he otherwise wouldn't face.

\begin{description}
\item[Increased technology]
with the referee's approval and a good narrative, the thing may be at one tech level above the cluster maximum: e.g. ``Grand\-ma's blaster'' an ancient T3 laser pistol that survived the last collapse. This works better for personal weapons or armour than for a spaceship, though conceivably two Stunts could justify owning a spaceship a tech level higher than the system maximum (not to exceed +4, naturally).

\item[Integral equipment]
when a character's design demands that some piece of standard equipment be intrinsic to his body, this Stunt provides it. Choose a piece of equipment of T0 or lower and it will always be present. Use Aspects to provide limitations if that feels necessary. Applying this stunt twice could grant functionality of a T2 or T1 piece of gear.
\end{description}

\subsection{Skill substitution}

Apply to one Skill, to benefit either yourself or an ally.

\begin{description}
\item[Swap a Skill]
Some Skill you have can be used in place of some other Skill you also have, to a maximum value of 3. If you want to use a high-ranking Skill at a higher level, this Stunt costs you a fate point each time it is used (high-ranking Skills can be used at level 3 without paying a point).

\item[Use my Skill]
allies can use the Skill you specify (or they may use it as another Skill) instead of their own, to a maximum value of three. You need to explain how this works and it should be conditional so that is not universally applicable.

\item[Take a bonus]
allies can use a Skill of at least level 3 to receive a +1 bonus to a roll, as specified. When there are restrictions, the effects may operate at the scale of space or platoon combat, subject to the approval of the referee.

Note: Using a ``Take a bonus'' Stunt in space combat counts as the character's action for that phase, and risks incurring Skill penalties for further actions later in the turn.
\end{description}

\subsection{Alter a Track}
Improve the length or functionality of one of your stress tracks and the way hits on them are mitigated.

\subsection{Free-form stunts}
Stunts like Military-grade that can have a player-defined effect are approved under the authority of the table --- that is, they are acceptable when there is consensus from all players.

Other Stunts might be created at the discretion of the table.
