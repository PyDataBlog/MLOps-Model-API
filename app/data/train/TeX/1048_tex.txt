\section{GN}
\subsection{Purpose}
Given the $n$th-order histogram output from \program{histogram}, \GN{} assembles the cross-correlations and produces all cross-correlations and the full autocorrelation. These results are normalized by intensity and bin width by default, but this behavior be suppressed with the flag \texttt{--no-bin-normalization}.

\subsection{Examples of usage}

\subsection{Implementation}
Most of the basic algorithms for this program have been laid out previously, so we will focus on the high-level tasks \GN{} must accomplish:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Parse the output from \program{histogram}.
\item For the autocorrelation, sum all counts from each cross-correlation.
\item For normalization, apply average intensities and bin widths.
\item Return the final correlations.
\end{enumerate}
