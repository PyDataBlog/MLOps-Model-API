\section{Radians}\label{sec:radians}

For all your mathematical life, you have been used to using degrees to measure
angles. In case you have forgotten (which would be concerning), here is a
refresher:

\begin{itemize}
\item There are 360 degrees (360\textdegree) in a full circle. A straight line
  therefore has an angle of 90\textdegree; a right angle an angle of
  180\textdegree; and an equilateral triangle has three angles, each of
  60\textdegree, and so forth.

\item Therefore, the length of an arc of a circle that subtends an angle of
  \(\theta^{\circ}\) is given by \(\frac{\theta}{360} \times 2\pi\).

\item Therefore further, the area of a sector of a circle, radius \(r\), with
  an angle of \(\theta^{\circ}\) is given by \(\frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi
  r^2\).
\end{itemize}

If the last two are not familiar to you, they are easily deducible: an angle of
\(\theta\) is \(\frac{\theta}{360}\)\textsuperscript{th}s of a circle, so it
makes sense that the length of the corresponding arc would also be
\(\frac{\theta}{360}\)\textsuperscript{th}s of the circumference of the circle.
The same goes for the formula for area.

Now think---how else could you do this? A superficially good solution would be
to have a full turn (i.e. 360\textdegree) as 100 units; alternatively, you
could use the \emph{gradian}, or ``metric degree'', whereby a right angle is
100 gradians (100 gon). Neither of these, however, is particularly
mathematically convenient.

Consider a unit circle (i.e. \(r = 1\)). One full turn around the circle is
\(2 \pi\), since \(\oslash = 2\pi r = 2\pi\). One full turn, in degrees, is
also 360\textdegree. Therefore, it makes sense to have the angle for one full
turn to be \(2 \pi\) units. This unit is called the \emph{radian}.

Here are some common angles, converted into radians:

\begin{longtable}[c]{@{} l l @{}}
  \toprule
  30\textdegree & \(\pi / 6\)\tabularnewline
  35\textdegree & \(\pi / 4\)\tabularnewline
  42\textdegree & \(7\pi / 30\)\tabularnewline
  60\textdegree & \(\pi / 3\)\tabularnewline
  90\textdegree & \(\pi / 2\)\tabularnewline
  180\textdegree & \(\pi\)\tabularnewline
  \bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Radians don't seem especially useful on their own. So why use them? For one,
there are some elegant proofs\footnote{Such as the famous
\(\text{e}^{i\pi} - 1 = 0\)} that rely on angles being measured in radians. But
more than that, they make the formulae for the length of an arc and the area of
a sector \emph{incredibly} easy:

\begin{align}
  s &= 2 \pi r \times \frac{\theta_{\text{degrees}}}{360}\nonumber\\
  &\equiv 2 \pi r \times \frac{\theta}{2\pi}\nonumber\\
  s &= r\theta
\end{align}

\begin{align}
  A &= \pi r^2 \times \frac{\theta_{\text{degrees}}}{360}\nonumber\\
  &\equiv \pi r^2 \times \frac{\theta}{2\pi}\nonumber\\
  A &= \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta
\end{align}

\begin{eg}
  \begin{align*}
    \theta &= \frac{5\pi}{18},\quad r = 3\,\text{cm}\\
    \Rightarrow s &= 3 \times \frac{5\pi}{18} = \frac{5}{6}\pi\\
    \Rightarrow A &= \frac{1}{2} \times 9 \times \frac{5\pi}{18} =
    \frac{5}{4}\pi
  \end{align*}
\end{eg}

That is about it with radians. The only thing to bear in mind is that all
trigonometric formulae must be either \emph{wholly} in radians or \emph{wholly}
in degrees.
