\section{Outline}

The idea here is a project to detect "news events" as they develop.  To do this I'd like to employ a number of the NLP tools that I've developed over the past year and a half.  The idea would be to identify topics from a topic model or some clustering in the word distributions to help explain news events.  I'd like to use my Twitter newspaper corpus to make this work and just keep build on that.  Though it would also be good to build on this with other source.  I could use the NYT API as a benchmark for other news sources.

\section{Methods for Detecting News Events}

\begin{itemize}
\item The main approach will likely be some form of topic modeling.  For this approach, topics will be estimated in real time and events will be detected when an individual topic proportion goes above a certain point that historically serves a threshold for an "event".  Events could also be identified by periods when the currently most popular topic is becoming increasingly coherent.
\item Another approach would be to look at a list of top words for the current text.  One approach here might be to identify events as periods where the set of words is consistent over a number of periods.  The idea here would be that when there aren't news events the words are largely random but when they appear to hold to a certain pattern we may be detecting a topic.  Another approach here that would be similar is to identify a set of words that correspond to a lack of events and identify events as periods where this set of words don't dominate.

\section{Estimating Topics}

\begin{itemize}
\item To estimate the topics I want to use some sort of online framework.  The idea here would be that we would maintain so record of the topics and update the topic model with new data as it comes in.
\item If this approach were to be used we would need a way to restart the online LDA code if the script crashes for whatever reason.
\end{itemize}

\section{Media Network}

\begin{itemize}
\item One possible way to detect events would be to look at the patterns in the interactions between different agents in the network.
\begin{itemize}
\item We could compare the top word lists for different agents.  When the top word lists align this might suggest a topic is developing.
\item We could look for patterns in how agents interact.  If agents who generally don't follow each other start following each other this might correspond to an event.
\end{itemize}
\item We can also estimate a regression on the topics estimated and treat each document as an author period pair.  See my network LDA work for more on this.  The idea here would be to estimate the influence that different agents have on each other.
\item Some measure of difference between most of teh news source and some sort of benchmark, like the NYT API would serve as an interesting tool.
\end{itemize}

\section{Code Structure}

\begin{itemize}
\item Scraper script.  This is the script that will build the topic model.
\item Network analysis script.  This is a script to analyze the interactions of the agents.
\end{itemize}
