\slide{Goal for today}

\hlkimage{5cm}{Shaking-hands_web.jpg}

This presentation will be focused on video conferencing security.

The picture illustrates working together but in these times,

we cannot shake hands and meet in the physical world as we used to.

We need video conferencing.

... but what about security

%\item Plan:
%\item Inspiration for solving the tasks, prioritizing the tasks
%\item I dont have tailer made solutions or easy answers for your organisation

People WILL try to abuse Video Conferencing



\slide{Confidentiality Integrity Availability}

\hlkimage{8cm}{cia-triad-uk.pdf}

\begin{list1}
\item We want to protect something
\item Confidentiality - data is kept confidential, secrets are secrets
\item Integrity - data is not subjected to unauthorized changes
\item Availability - data and systems are available for authorized users when they need it
\end{list1}





\slide{All software has flaws}

The Internet Worm 2. nov 1988

\begin{list1}
\item Exploited the following vulnerabilities
\begin{list2}
\item buffer overflow in fingerd - VAX code
\item Sendmail - DEBUG functionality
\item Trust between systems: rsh, rexec, ...
\item Bad passwords
\end{list2}
\item Contained camouflage!
\begin{list2}
\item Program name set to 'sh'
\item Used fork() to switch PID regularly
\item Password cracking using intern list of 432 words and /usr/dict/words
\item Found systems to infect in /etc/hosts.equiv, .rhosts, .forward, netstat ...
\end{list2}
\item Made byRobert T. Morris, Jr.

\slide{Attacking Video Conferencing}

%\hlkrightpic{8cm}{-2cm}{brian-patrick-tagalog-680954-unsplash.jpg}
%{~}

\begin{list2}
\item Sniffing and eavesdropping
\item Zoom bombing, joining unauthorized, causing chaos
\item Encryption: even if you use AES, do you use it correctly
\item Software security: All video conferencing has had security vulnerabilities
\end{list2}

\slide{Zoom Settings }

%\hlkimage{}{}

\begin{quote}

\end{quote}

\begin{list2}
\item Improved a lot during April and May
\end{list2}

\slide{Problems: Zoom bombing}

%\hlkimage{}{}

Problems
\begin{list2}
\item Participants can join, no password, guessable room IDs
\item Audio - participants can talk
\item Screen sharing - taking over screen
\end{list2}

Solutions
\begin{list2}
\item Using passwords for meetings
\item Only send link directly to intended participants
\item Waiting room - admit people, also have another person monitoring during conference
\item Audio - muting
\item Screen sharing - security setting, disable - now a default in May 2020
\end{list2}

\slide{My Conclusion on Zoom}

\begin{quote}\bf
Zoom video conferencing is great for teaching, use it myself.

Zoom video conferencing has had issues with encryption so maybe not for the most security critical meetings.

Is Zoom improving, definitely!
\end{quote}

\begin{list2}
\item BTW Are mobile phones secure, is calling through the telephone network secure, probably not
\item No I dont own shares in Zoom.us
