\section{Linearization/Tangent line approximation}
This is section 3.10 in your textbook.  Given a function and a point, you should be able to find the linear approximation of the point and then estimate values of the function at nearby points.  You can use formula \#2 on page 251, but remember that all you need to find a linear approximation is a point and a slope (derivative), and you can use the point-slope form of a line.  

\begin{itemize}
	\item Linearize: $f(x) = \sqrt{x+3}$, $a=1$, Estimate: $f(0.98)$ and $f(1.05)$
	\item Linearize: $y=e^{x/10}$, $a=0$, Estimate: $f(0.1)$
	\item Linearize: $V(x)=x^3$, $a=30$, Estimate $f(29.9)$ and $f(30.1$)
\end{itemize}

Bonus study items: Differentials on page 253.  The last two linearization problems above are actually \#15 and \#33 from section 3.10.  See if you can do them using differentials instead of a linearization.

\section{Absolute Extrema}
This is section 4.1 in your textbook.  Given a function you should be able to find the absolute maximum and minimum values of that function over a closed interval (also given).  You can use the Closed Interval Method on page 278.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Find the absolute extrema of $f(x)=x^3-3x^2+1$ on the domain $[-\frac{1}{2},4]$
	\item Find the absolute minimum and maximum values of the function $$f(x)=x-2\sin(x)$$ on the interval $0\leq x \leq 2\pi$
	\item Find the absolute extrema of the function $$a(t)=0.003906t^2-0.18058t+23/61$$ over the interval $[0,126]$
\end{itemize}

Bonus study items:  The Closed Interval Method is guaranteed to work because of the Extreme Value Theorem and Fermat's Theorem (which tells us about critical numbers).  Look at examples \#1 through \#7  in section 4.1 to understand all the underlying concepts.

\section{Local Extrema}
This is section 4.3 in your textbook. You should be very familiar with the relationship between slopes and derivatives already, and be able to prove whether a critical point is a local min or a local max (or neither).  Use the first derivative test from page 291 or the second derivative test on page 295 to do so.  You should also be able to use the second derivative to tell where a derivative is concave up or concave down.  Use the concavity test on page 293 to do so.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Find all local minimum and maximum values of the function $$f(x)=12x(x-2)(x+1)$$
	\item Find all local minimum and maximum values of the function $$g(x)=x+2\sin x$$ on the interval $(0,2\pi)$
	\item Find the inflection points of the function $f(x)=x^4-4x^3$. State over which intervals the function is concave up and which intervals the function is concave down.
	\item Find the inflection points of the function $f(x)=x^{2/3}(6-x)^{1/3}$. State over which intervals the function is concave up and which intervals the function is concave down.
\end{itemize}

\section{Optimization}
This is section 4.7 in your textbook.  Use the problem solving method on pages 352-326 in your book.  The hardest part is setting up the objective function, and after that is is just applying the knowledge from sections 4.1 and 4.3 to find the minimum or maximum.  Don't forget to answer what the question is asking- i.e., if we ask for the dimensions of a cylinder make sure to tell us the radius AND the height.

\begin{itemize}
	\item A farmer has 2,400 ft of fencing and wants to fence off a rectangular field that borders a straight river.  He needs no fence along the river.  What are the dimensions of the field that has the largest area?
	\item A cylindrical can is made to hold 1 liter of oil.  Find the dimensions of the can that will minimize the metal used to manufacture the can.
	\item A store has been selling 200 Blu-ray players per week at \$350 each.  A market survey indicates that for each \$10 rebate offered to buyers, the number of units will increase by 20 a week.  Find the demand function and the revenue function.  How large a rebate should the store offer to maximize it's revenue?  Note:  for each rebate offered the price of the Blu-ray player falls \$10.
\end{itemize}

Bonus study items: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Find the point on the (sideways) parabola $y^2=x$ that is closest to the point (1,4).
	\item What is the area of the largest rectangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle of radius $r$?
\end{itemize}
