\section{General Facts about the Verlinde Bundles}

This section introduces the main objects of study of this thesis, the Verlinde bundles of the universal family of hypersurfaces of degree $d$ in $\PP^n$. These were already studied as an example of Verlinde bundles of polarized families in the thesis \cite{hemminghaus-verlinde-bundles}. We reproduce the fundamental results about the Verlinde bundles, such as the fact they really are vector bundles, and introduce a presentation that we will employ throughout the rest of this work.

Throughout the rest of the thesis, we assume $n>1$.
