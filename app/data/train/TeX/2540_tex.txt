    \frametitle{Purpose of today's lecture}
\begin{itemize}
\item Look at CMC research motivated by theories of language
\item Understand what these theories are all about:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Communities of Practice}
	\item \emph{Conversation Analysis}
	\item \emph{Computer-mediated discourse analysis}
\end{itemize}
\item Problematise \emph{community}
\item Talk about \citeNP{stommel_conversation_2008}
\item Last minute wiki stuff
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Context: formalism/functionalism}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Longheld division between theoretical linguistics/applied linguistics, formalism/functionalism
	\item Formal = generative grammar (i.e. Chomsky), psycholinguistics
	\item Formal linguistics simultaneously casts functional branches as excessively complex and theoretically impoverished \cite{martin_english_1992}
	\item Poststructural discourse would contest the idea that generative grammar is somehow theoeretically neutral, anyway
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Context: functional linguistics}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Language is a sign-system (see de Saussure, Firth, Halliday)
	\item Description of instances of language shows how the sign-system is structured
	\item Our explanation of texts can reveal the connection between the sign-system and the uses to which language is put \cite{martin_english_1992} 
	\item Language is \textbf{a resource for making meaning}, rather than \emph{a system of rules}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Context: functionalism + community}
\begin{itemize}
	\item There are many different types of functional linguistics
	\item Increasingly, it's seen as OK to pick and choose from between them \cite<as in>{eggins_analysing:_2004,herring_computer-mediated_2004}
	\item Today the theme is \emph{community} in CMC
	\item `The existence of virtual community is a fundamental question that needs to be addressed if the term is to be used meaningfully, rather than purely metaphorically' \cite[p.~23]{herring_computer-mediated_2004}
	\item What can we say about virtual community using a few of these functional models of language?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Community}
A working definition: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Interaction via one or more \emph{modes}
		\item Between people with sets of \emph{roles} and \emph{relationships}
		\item often \emph{about something}
	\end{enumerate}
	So, why is community of interest in CMC?
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item History of CMC (Week 1)
	\item Important for big companies, health contexts
	\item A site of learning...
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Community: the \emph{learner}}
\begin{itemize}
\item We saw last week the idea of novice and expert identities/roles---but what's in between?
	\item Vygotsky's sociocultural approach (Week 4)
	\item In his later work, he talks about the \emph{Zone of Proximal Development} (ZPD) \citeyear<e.g.>{vygotsky_mind_1978}
	\item This is the place we should try to situate learners, where they:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item can, through the instructor, do better than they would alone
		\item can make mistakes without serious consequences
	\end{itemize}
	\item The apprentice \cite<see>{herzfeld_body_2004}
	\item Legitimate peripheral membership \cite<see>{lave_situated_1991}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Communities of Practice}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A model for investigating (smaller) communities developed by \citeA{lave_situated_1991,wenger_communities_1998} (from anthropology)
	\item Initially studied subgroups within high school student body
	\item Community = people who have:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Shared repertoire
		\item Mutual engagement
		\item Common goal (joint enterprise) \cite{davies_communities_2005}
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Note that these pattern with tenor, mode, field in SFL!
	\item Contrast CofP with \emph{speech communities} \cite<i.e.>{labov_social_1972}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{CofP: Community structure}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Three main classes of members:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Core/full
		\item (Legitimate) peripheral
		\item Marginal \cite{eckert_think_1992}
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Inward or outward trajectory; gatekeeping
	\item Brokering (change in repertoire)
	\item Of course, the usual poststructural caveats: overlap, identity fragmentation, etc.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Conversation Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
	\item `West Coast functionalism'
	\item Schegloff, Sacks, Jefferson: sociologists, not linguists!
	\item Designed for casual conversation, now encompassing many other genres
	\item Very popular (esp. in USA)
	\item Well-established methodology including rigorous transcription (i.e. pause timing, laughter pulses, etc.)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

  \end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{CA: key concepts}
\begin{itemize}
\item Non-cognitive: the transcriptions are enough
	\item Mode-focussed: reference, conjunction, cohesion
	\item Has its own conceptualisation of identity:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Categorical: vocational/demographic groups to which you belong
		\item Situational: specific to interaction \cite[pp.~3--4]{stommel_conversation_2008}
	\end{itemize}
	\item \emph{Turn construction unit} as main analytical unit
	\item Adjacency pairs
	\item Repair
	\item Topic shift via \emph{transition relevance place}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Adjacency pairs in CMC}
We all know that adjacency pairs can get messed up in chat:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item ~~~~~S1: How was your day?
	\item ~~~~~S1: Did you sleep in?
	\item ~~~~~S2: I did
	\item ~~~~~S1: Awesome
	\item ~~~~~S2: It was great
\end{enumerate}
This kind of case is interesting---but please \textbf{do not} argue that multi-party chat = disrupted adjacency!
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Repair in CMC}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Takes more forms than have been acknowledged
	\item We repair typos, factual error, fix formatting issues, add sources
	\item Conventions seem to appear quickly
	\item Do edits to Reddit posts count?
	\item Anything on the wikis?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

 \begin{frame}
 \frametitle{`Repair' in Reddit}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Computer-mediated discourse analysis}
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item Herring \citeyear<e.g.>{herring_computer-mediated_2004} has written down some great guidelines for researching CMD 
 	\item Discourse:
 	\begin{enumerate}
 	\item exists in texts
 		\item features recurrent patterns
 		\item involves speaker choice
 	\end{enumerate}
 	\item Consider medium and situation factors: (how) does the mode shape the situation and the discourse?
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{CMDA: academic process}
 \begin{enumerate}
 	\item Form and articulate research questions (in response to \textbf{Lit review)}
 	\item Select data \textbf{(Case study)}
 	\item Determine how phenomenon of interest \emph{(e.g. community)} might play out in the data (e.g. use of \emph{jargon}, appearance of \emph{rules})
 	\item Select and apply analytical methods \textbf{(Methodology)}
 	\item Interpret results:
 	\begin{enumerate}
 		\item Summarise \textbf{(Findings)}
 		\item Answer RQs \textbf{(Discussion)}
 		\item Consider implications \textbf{(Future research)}
 	\end{enumerate}
 \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Stommel \& CofP \citeyear{stommel_conversation_2008}}
\begin{itemize}
	\item This paper looks at an online support group for eating disorders using CA and CofP
	\item Answering Herring's questioning of virtual community:
	\item `[whether] interactive practices constitute community'!? \cite[p.~1]{stommel_conversation_2008}
	\item Novices go to `new here' pages, construct uncertainty (and legitimate periphery position?) through `not sure if i'm in the right place...'
	\item Moderators politely enforce rules, but also extend rules into ideology
	\item Stommel argues that CofP helps understand the `context' of forum rules
	\item Movement between specific interactions (CA) and the rules invoked (CofP) therein
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{A research agenda:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item `More systematic research on web-based platforms is necessary to illuminate the exact relation between interactional activities and the criteria for online community, so as to understand more precisely what CA and CoP can reveal about online interactive behavior' \cite[p.~17]{stommel_conversation_2008}.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Stommel paper: shortcomings}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We can all understand and describe texts;
	\item \emph{Explanation} is better, though: use specific examples of a phenomenon, and try to count things when you can
	\item What's the point of this talk about \emph{community}? Do we question whether the term is useful in offline contexts?
	\item Watch out for language like this: `How Discursive Identities Construct Community in Interaction' (p.~5)
	\item Using CofP on online communities may empty it of meaning, esp. where participation is low and drop-out is high \cite{herring_computer-mediated_2004}:
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{\emph{/r/linguistics, tex.stackexchange}}
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item What's going on here?
 	\item We can learn a lot about the kind of communities these are by the linguistic practices of the moderators who speak on the communities' behalf.
 	\item and obviously, the medium affects the lexicogrammar of the texts
 	\item Also note that when moderators are active in communities, we're often left analysing only the moderated content
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Important points from today}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Community in CMC is a contested notion for better and worse reasons
	\item Perhaps let's just look at community as one archetype of \emph{group}
	\item Explicit rules and moderation are always interesting
	\item CA is a good theory to choose when you're interested in interaction
	\item CofP, \emph{when used as a set of heuristics}, is valuable too
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Wiki time}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Last chance for talk about the first assignment
	\item Casual or goal-directed communication?
	\item Identities at play?
	\item Paralinguistics?
	\item Misunderstandings?
	\item Multimodality (inc. hyperlinks)?
	\item Identity? Community?
	\item ... or, stop by my office today. Arts West 406: 14.00--17.00
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Wednesday and beyond}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We still need to look at critical linguistics, genre theory, etc.
	\item Wednesday tute: identity/community
	\item Lecture: systemic functional perspectives on CMC
\end{itemize}
