\begin{problema}{Nuts and Bolts}{Standard}{Standard}{UVa}

One afternoon your cell phone rings; it's your cousin Jimmy.
"Hi Cuz," he says, "I need your help and I need it fast. I'm in the middle of a programming contest and however hard I try, I can't get one problem to finish within the two second time limit."

"Hmm... well..., isn't that a bit illegal?", you try to say to him. But he rattles on.

"I just snook out of the contest room and managed to send you my code and the sample I/O by email", he continues without pausing. "I will check my mail again in an hour, so please make it work for me."

"What about the problem description?", you ask.

"Can't do", he says, "Zoroman the Head Judge is already on my tail, so I got to go. Bye, ... and, eh, thanks."

Are you going to help him? \\ \\
