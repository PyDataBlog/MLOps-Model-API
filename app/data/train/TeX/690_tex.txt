\section{Problem E}
\textit{Perform time reversal in a MISO context for each set of 2 channel realizations (one from A and one from D). Calculate the average power delay profile of the equivalent channel and from that the delay spread. How does it compare to the delay spread calculated in B and C?}\\

Applying time reversal in a MISO fashion means to sum the autocorrelation functions (convolutions) of each of the received antenas (see last slide in page 4 of mm1).

The time reversed signal in a MISO fashion is shown in \figref{fig:ex_e_miso_2channels}

\end{figure}

As an extra, we decided to do the time reversal of the signal in a MISO fashion using 16 antennas instead of 2. The resulted time reversed signal is shown in \figref{fig:ex_e_miso_16channels}

In these cases the delay spread was similar to that calculated for one antenna.\\

In \tref{tab:power_del_spread} the power delay spread of all the calculated cases are reported.
