\section{Background of Study}

Existing engineering drawings describing machines and buildings date back to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Most of these are bounded volumes stored in European museums and libraries, particularly in southern Europe where the Moorish Civilization thrived in Cordoba, and viewing them is restricted primarily to academic researchers. Today, we would describe them more as sketches than as technical drawings. They were not to scale nor did they have dimensions. Many of these documents contain extensive textual descriptions that help one understand the intent of the drawings.

Early engineering drawings served two purposes. On one hand, they were a reference experienced craftsmen used to build or construct what was portrayed. While the drawings were more symbolic than what we are familiar with today, these craftsmen understood the intent of their iconic descriptions and were not concerned by the lack of dimensions since every machine or building they worked on was unique. The other function of these drawings, particularly those collected in portfolios, was for presentation to the designer’s patron, either a prince or wealthy merchant.

Some of the best known early engineering drawings is the work of \newthought{Leonardo da Vinci}. While he is well known for his Mona Lisa, he was also a designer of military machines and forerunners of today’s industrial machines. Leonardo’s design work was artistic in nature - more illustration than engineering drawings. No multi-view drawings of any of his designs are known to exist today. Yet during the past century, skilled craftsmen were able to construct models of many of his designs working strictly from his sketches.  


\section{Statement of the Problem}

The \texttt{pull}(unpush) command is a high priority project for BRL-CAD. The pull command seeks to restore the original state of the CSG tree from any particular node after the push command has been executed. However, the \texttt{push} command is used to walk the geometry tree from a specified head node to the leaf nodes(primitive level), collecting the matrix transformations such as (translations, rotations or scales) applied to new assemblies using matrix edits(\texttt{oed} command). The push then applies the matrix transformation parameters to the primitives, eliminating the need for storing the various matrix transformations thereby setting them to identity matrices. 

This process looses any local coordinate system used in constructing the geometric objects. The pull routine seeks to restore the original tree state by reversing any tranformation operations performed on the primitive shapes from a designated top node on the CSG tree. Here, I will have a sample routine that takes as argument a designated node(such as a primitive) and performs the Inverse of any rotation, Inverse of any translation and the inverse of a scale.) and performs the matrix inverse the primitive matrix.


\section{Purpose of the Study}

Most early practitioners of engineering drawings – such as Leonardo were also artists. Gradually, a realization developed that drawings had to stand on their own merits and that greater precision was needed. One early proponent of this belief was Leon Battista Alberti who, in 1435 and 1436, wrote two works that explored the need to incorporate more Euclidian geometry\parencite{13} in contemporary drawings. He also proposed drawings with multiple views rather than the single view then common.

However modern engineering design and drafting practice can probably be traced back to the development of descriptive geometry, especially the work of René Descartes (1596–1650) and Gaspard Monge (1746–1818). Engineering drawing began to evolve more rapidly in the late 18th century and picked up speed with the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century.

Drafting standards, as we know them today, were not taken seriously until after World War I\parencite{14}. Like contemporary penmanship, this is a skill that few retain. Computer Aided Design systems have been developed to facilitate modern engineering assisting artists, designers and architects perfrom drawing with was previously done only using a pencil, T-square, triangles, scales, irregular (French) curves and using drawing instruments such as compasses and dividers. Moreover these systems have evolved over the years by the constant evolutions of features in packages such as BRL-CAD. This study aims at implementing a new capability for BRL-CAD which will have a huge effect on the CAD community and evolving the industry of engineering design.

\section{Significance of the Study}

CAD is mainly used for detailed engineering of 3D models and/or 2D drawings of physical components, but it is also used throughout the engineering process from conceptual design and layout of products, through strength and dynamic analysis of assemblies to definition of manufacturing methods of components. It can also be used to design objects. Furthermore, many CAD applications now offer advanced rendering and animation capabilities so engineers can better visualize their product designs. 4D \keyword{BIM} is a type of virtual construction engineering simulation incorporating time or schedule related information for project management.

CAD has become an especially important technology within the scope of computer-aided technologies, with benefits such as lower product development costs and a greatly shortened design cycle. CAD enables designers to layout and develop work on screen, print it out and save it for future editing, saving time on their drawings.

\section{Outline of the remaining Chapters}

This document consists of five (5) chapters. Chapter 2 reviews literature on Computer Aided Design. Chapter 3  states the research method used in implementing the pull routine; in addition to data structures and algorithms employed. Chapter 4 presents the results obtained and sample use cases for the pull routine. Finally, Chapter 5 states the conclusions drawn from the work and further directions in which the command can be improved.
