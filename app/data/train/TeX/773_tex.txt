This plugin builds three components\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item libcommotion\+\_\+serval-\/dna -\/ This is the main plugin library that re-\/implements the \href{https://github.com/servalproject/serval-dna/}{\tt Serval} Distributed Numbering Architecture (serval-\/dna) daemon.
\item serval-\/client -\/ This is a client program that offers all of serval-\/dna's built-\/in commands, as well as signing and signature verification using Serval keys.
\item libcommotion\+\_\+serval-\/sas -\/ A library that implements a minimal M\+D\+P client for fetching an S\+A\+S signing key over the M\+D\+P overlay network. This will be deprecated once commotiond has a more full-\/ featured event loop.
