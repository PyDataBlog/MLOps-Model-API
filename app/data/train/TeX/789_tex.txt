\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related-work}

Pixel-wise segmentation was successfully applied in other domains. For example,
\cite{bittel2015pixel} introduces a system which does pixel-wise segmentation
for autonomous cars of the classes \textit{street} and \textit{no street}. A
more detailed introduction to semantic segmentation can be found
in~\cite{thoma2016survey}.

An early example of semantic segmentation in medicine
is~\cite{wei1997automatic}. The authors suggested to place a marker on the
instrument which can easily be distinguished from background just by color. The
problem with this approach is that existing medical instruments can not easily
be colored due to costly approval procedures. Hence a semantic segmentation
algorithm which works with existing medical instruments is necessary.

For example, in~\cite{allan2013toward} the authors detected and localized
surgical instruments in laparoscopic images to estimate the pose of the
instrument in 3D. They used Random Forests.
