\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Context}
\begin{itemize}
\item We spoke in Week 2 about the 20thC shift from one to multiple identities
\item We need to flesh some of this out a little, though
\item CMC often involves radical disconnection of the communicative and the `biometric' self: ``the internet mediates the construction of identities through an infinite number of overlapping social spaces that are often contradictory in form and content'' \cite[p.~48]{williams_applying_2013}
\item The anonymity afforded by many CMC sites adds further to identity theorists' interest in online communication
\item Researchers are just starting to grapple with the effects of social networks (and \emph{post} social networks)
\end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Identity: theoretical foundations}
    Contemporary applied linguistics tends to characterise identity in three ways \cite<from>{macedo_researching_2013}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Discursively constructed} (through interrelated, overlapping \emph{texts})
\item \emph{Temporary} (and shifting in response to identities of others)
\item \emph{Fragmented} (through negotiation of perspectives)
\end{itemize}
We want to either \emph{design} or \emph{apply} good methods for collecting and analysing the texts that construct identity
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Identity fragmentation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Three types of identity \cite<from>{finch_what_2003}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Individual
\item Social
\item Legal
\end{enumerate}
\begin{itemize}
\item ... are there others?
\end{itemize}
\item Criteria for identification vary according to context;
\item Think about how you show your passport vs. how you determine if you're not dreaming:
\begin{itemize}
	\item This process is similar to the way different CMC modes reveal different things about us
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Identity: theoretical foundations}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Front stage} as the public performance
\begin{itemize}
\item We try to perform the \emph{idealised} self
\item Audience monitoring/consuming the front stage performance
\item Thus, a person could `lose face' and/or incur social sanctions
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Back stage} as the private performance:
\begin{itemize}
\item ``a place, relative to a given performance, where the impression fostered by the performance is knowingly contradicted as a matter of course'' \cite[p.~112]{goffman_presentation_1959}
\end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Anonymity: theoretical foundations}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Anonymous = \emph{nameless}
    \item ... but Anonymous \emph{is} a name, and even a recognisable archetype
	\item Closely tied to authorship/communication---the top 10 collocates from COCA:\nocite{davies_corpus_2008}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Anonymity: theoretical foundations}
\begin{itemize}
\item Anonymity is \emph{discursively constructed} through omission
\item Omission may be intended or unintended; easy or difficult to achieve
\item Anonymity can be social or legal, but not (often) individual
\item Deanonymisation as contextually bound \emph{sufficient identification}
\item Identification is perhaps a \emph{felicity condition} for social sanctions to `work'
\item Anonymity deserves more scholarly attention than it gets:
\begin{itemize}
	\item It is the main resource for `getting away with it' 
	\item Hacktivism, whistleblowing
	\item Increased response rate for issues in which responders face social stigma \cite{hines_characteristics_2007}
	\item Entertainment: \emph{Reddit}, \emph{Chatroulette}, messages in bottles...

\begin{itemize}
\item Qualitative study of identity in a Rolling Stones online fanclub
\item ``The purposes of the paper are two-fold: [...]
\item to delineate how fan identity may occupy a middle area between `real' and fantasy elements of self-presentation, and [...]
\item to gain insight into the mix of offline and online behaviors and attitudes among fans, or to explain how the real and virtual combine'' (p.~8)
\item Research questions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item How do fans present themselves online?
	\item  How do the online identity and the offline identity of fans inter-relate?
\end{enumerate}
\item Sustained monitoring of, interviewing, meeting with participants

    \frametitle{The \emph{Shattered} forum: practices}
\begin{itemize}
\item Usernames merge self and band identity: \emph{Stonesdoug, akissaway}
\item Fans of the board orient toward either Mick or Keith (and this appears to be gendered)
\item Obscure facts demonstrate expertise: ``the somewhat obscure user ID `Arthur' came from a break in a recording session when Mick used that name for Keith, when he was slow coming in, possibly due to Keith's real or imagined “arthur-itis” at the time'' (p.~16).
\item Avatars serve two purposes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item ``to show they've literally come close to the subjects of the board; and 
\item to allow others to recognize them offline'' (p.~12)
\end{enumerate}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Blended identity?}
\begin{itemize}
\item `Blended identity' is a term introduced to deal with the relationship between online/offline identities.
\item Researching it means trying to ascertain how people:
\begin{enumerate}
\item ``derive identities online related to their offline experiences and the online community they have joined; and then
\item migrate from online to offline bringing with them the online identities that they then introduce to others whom they have met first online'' (p.~15).
\end{enumerate}
\item What happens when the forum members meet each other at gigs and meetups?
\begin{itemize}
\item Identifiable t-shirts for FtF meeting
\item Telling people offline about their use of the forum (!?)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Baker (2009): shortcomings}
\begin{itemize}
\item Great focus on forum features, multimodality, identity
\item ... but why so little analysis of member interactions?
\item Harvest things from the forum systemically if you can, and use that corpus, rather than just observation
\item How are the Rolling Stones and forum members \emph{appraised} \cite<see>{martin_language_2005}
\item \emph{Women want them, men wanna be them}

\begin{itemize}
\item \citeA[p.~1]{hogan_presentation_2010}: ``The world is not only a stage but also a library and a gallery''
\item \emph{Performance} and \emph{artifact}
\item Perhaps update Goffman's metaphor to \emph{exhibition}, rather than \emph{stage play}
\item The individual as computer-assisted \emph{curator}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Mediated identity: what's changed?}
\begin{itemize}
\item The web has changed dramatically in the past few years (Week 1)
\item Less anonymity, more integration with the offline world
\item Strategic self performance and \emph{Myspace}
\item \emph{Facebook, Instagram} ... ?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{In the current web ...}
Social media as serving three identity functions \cite{zhao_many_2013}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Performance (curation of recently added information)
\item Exhibition (longer-term)
\item Personal archive (diary, keepsakes, etc)
\item  \emph{... but what about Snapchat, Tinder, Reddit, Disqus, etc?}
\end{enumerate}

    \frametitle{Posing challenges for theory}
\begin{itemize}
\item In your assignments, you may want to consider the applicability of key theories to your (CMC) data.
\item If the theory works partially, perhaps there is a gap that needs to be filled?
\item Explain how future research (that maybe you could conduct, with time and money...) could solve the issue.
\item Or, perhaps the theory would benefit with integration with another theory/methodology?
\item If so, suggest a future study that could prove the viability of the combination of theories/methodologies
\item So, let's say we did a case study of ``\emph{Social sanction in CNN comments}'' (\url{http://edition.cnn.com/20../02/us/us-spy-plane/index.html\%3Fiid=article_sidebar?iref=obinsite})

    \frametitle{Goffman and CNN comments}
\begin{itemize}
\item There are conflicts in pseudo-anonymous CNN comments. Not much can be done but simply argue back.
\item Moderators may exist, but do not contribute.
\item From Goffman's perspective, identification of the actor by the audience is a felicity condition for social sanctions to operate, and thus for a loss of face to occur.
\item On Disqus, identification is limited to a disposable username and optional avatar
\item Some comments resemble back stage
\item `no performance is necessary' in order for the actor avoid a loss of face, as the sanctions that facilitate the punishment cannot be properly imposed.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Foucault and CNN comments}
\begin{itemize}
\item \citeA{foucault_discipline_1977} argues that omnipresent social surveillance leads to self-policing (as in the Panopticon)
\item Have commenters in fact internalised the normative rules that, as a result of their anonymity, they may break, but cannot be charged by others with breaking?
\item It seems like commenters have discovered that sanctions are not really felicitous, and partially free themselves from self-surveillance
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Austin and CNN comments}
\begin{itemize}
\item Remember \citeA{austin_how_1975}, felicity conditions and illocutionary/perlocutionary force? (Week 2)
\item \citeA{austin_plea_1956} also discusses excuses: we pretend to believe them in order to be able to rely on them ourselves at a later stage
\item Commenters realise, upon facing criticism, that anonymity mutes the perlocutionary force
\item They then realise that their own criticisms carry equally little weight
\item They adjust their tone to compensate (hence the constant abuse)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Open questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Is it still possible to perform an \emph{idealised self} on social media?
\item Should we keep using Goffman's stage metaphor in CMC research? Is the \emph{exhibition} metaphor better?
\item How have technological affordances of new modes changed your identity performance practices?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\note{x}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Summing up}
\begin{itemize}
\item We saw from Baker's article that technological change may change the ways in which we perform/curate our identity
\item We saw that there are a few good angles for understanding identity in the current web landscape, too
\item Tutorial, next lecture: orientation toward normative community values in online communities
\item Assignment questions, etc.? \nocite{baker_mick_2009,williams_applying_2013}
