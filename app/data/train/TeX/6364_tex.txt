% here the final "9" of the commentary would be cut too sharp. The reason is that
% the italic "9" glyph in the libertine font is larger than its bounding box, the
% dimension of which that TeX is actually aware (which is normal for italic), so we
% have manually insert the italic correction (`\/`), the small kern which is normally
% used when switching from italics to upright fonts.
% To do this we redefine the commentary style so that it adds the italic correction at
% the end.  Because the commentary will be put into a box, we need to hide this in a
% conditional to prevent LaTeX from complaining about the mode itâ€™s in when it fills
% the box.
