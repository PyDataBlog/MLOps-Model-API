This problem simulates the trajectory of a charged particle in an
external magnetic field. It illustrates the effect mass has on the
trajectory of such a particle.

The direction of the magnetic field is
perpendicular to the simlated plane. The particle trajectory is
integrated by updating a velocty with the force and position with the
force and velocty for each iteration.

In order to run the Python version of the problem:

\begin{lstlisting}
python trajectory.py
\end{lstlisting}

It should produce the following output plot:
