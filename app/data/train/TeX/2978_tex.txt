\QuickQuizChapter{chp:Conflicting Visions of the Future}{Conflicting Visions of the Future}

This chapter presents some conflicting visions of the future of parallel
programming.
It is not clear which of these will come to pass, in fact, it is not
clear that any of them will.
They are nevertheless important because each vision has its devoted
adherents, and if enough people believe in something fervently enough,
you will need to deal with at least the shadow of that thing's existence
in the form of its
influence on the thoughts, words, and deeds of its adherents.
Besides which, it is entirely possible that one or more of these visions
will actually come to pass.
But most are bogus.
Tell which is which and you'll be rich~\cite{KeithRSpitz1977}!

Therefore, the following sections give an overview of transactional
memory, hardware transactional memory,
shared-memory parallel functional programming, and
process-based parallel functional programming.
But first, a cautionary tale on prognostication taken from the early 2000s.
