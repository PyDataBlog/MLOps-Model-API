\subsubsection{Mobile phones association}
For enhanced security it's required two telephones are associated before they can send commands to the other one; the association is bidirectional and   can be removed only locally (the other telephone won't know anything, but will obviously fail in sending commands). This totally cuts away the possibility of a Man In The Middle (MITM) both active and passive. A user who wants to associate his telephone with another one first selects a secret question and a secret answer and sends the first to the other mobile, whose user can decide to accept or refuse the request. In the second case the first user is notified back and the association ends with a "failure", otherwise the second user types what he thinks is the secret answer and selects his own secret question/answer. The first user now has to type the answer to that question and, if all goes smooth, the association is done. Every passage is done by sms sending.
