\paragraph{Public key sending} \hspace{0pt} \\
The response to a public key request is a message made by the header "CODE2FFF" and the public key itself; of course also the happening of this sending is saved in the preferences updating the SMP log file. The receiver, after the sms validation, writes into the preferences the event and stores in the so called "KeySquare", a keyring of the not yet validated keys, a Base64 representation of the key.
