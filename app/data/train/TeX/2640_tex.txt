\subsection{Memory organization}

CPU can address up to $2^{24}$ words, whole memory space is linear. Everything
is in one memory space, there is nothing like IO space, program space, data
space. MARK II CPU following Von Neumann scheme, so program and also data is in
one space. Peripherals and IO devices should be mapped there too.

There are two instruction for working with memory. One is LD for reading from
memory, and second is ST for writing into memory. Both instruction can use
absolute addressing mode (address is part of instruction) or indirect
addressing with register (address is stored in register).

\subsubsection{Stack}

Stack is used for storing returning address when calling subroutines or
interrupts. It grow from up to down. So, you should set SP at end of ram.

You can also use stack for storing your variables/registers etc. There is two
special functions for that.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{PUSH} - store data into stack and decrement SP
    \item \textbf{POP} - take data from stack and increment SP
\end{itemize}
