I would like to sincerely thank my supervisor Dr. Advisor's Name for his continuous guidance and encouragement throughout the course of this work. His enthusiasm and valuable feedback for research made my study very enjoyable and exciting and ultimately fruitful with rich experience. I would also like to thank him for providing me with an amazing research environment.

I thank my parents for their continuous encouragement and my siblings for bearing with me for my negligence towards them during this journey and their deep moral support at all times.

Lastly, I would like to thank the people at KAUST, Thuwal, Makkah Province, Saudi Arabia for providing support and resources for this research work.
