\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Today's objectives}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Summarise what we've learned
	\item Figure out a few things we could do with this knowledge
	\item Wrap up
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Week 1}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Evolution of the web to its current state
	\item Some concepts and terminology: \emph{participatory}, \emph{user-generated}, \emph{discourse}, \emph{multimodal} \dots
	\item \emph{WTF was Kony?} \cite{harsin_wtf_2013}: are we studying texts or events?
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Week 2}
	
	Here we started looking at CMC as a focus of (applied) linguistics
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Crash course in big ideas: Austin, Goffman, Kendon, Halliday \dots
	\item Can we bring identity theory, gesture studies, speech act theory, etc., into CMC research?
	\end{itemize}

To understand this, we needed to talk about:

	\begin{itemize}
	\item The relationship between the online and offline
	\item Whether or not the distinction is unhelpful
	\item CMC and illocutionary force \cite{dresner_functions_2010}
	\item Mediated embodiment \cite{schandorf_mediated_2013}
	\item The real and the virtual \cite{gunkel_real_2010}
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Week 3: Work and the wiki}
	

	Week 3 was centred on Nardi's notions of \emph{affinity}, \emph{commitment} and \emph{attention} as key factors in work-context CMC. Many of you discussed this in your first paper, where you also learned about:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Autoethnography
		\item \emph{Meanings made as choices made}
		\item A taste of the corporate world?
	\end{itemize}

	Most of you are digital natives, but noted that offline communication was key to getting things done. Can we reconcile that with our theoretical assumptions?
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Week 4}
	
	Here, we focussed on identity, as conceptualised by \citeA{goffman_presentation_1959}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Front and backstage
		\item Fragmented if we're fidelity fl 
		\item Negotiated
		\item Blended  identity \cite{baker_mick_2009}
	\end{itemize}

	Identity is inherently bound up in:

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Anonymity and its effects
	\item Virtual community
	\item Normative values/socialisation
	\item Corpus linguistic methods for investigating socialisation
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Week 5}
	
	We abandoned formalism in favour of functional linguistic approaches, such as \emph{Communities of Practice}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item What kind of group members are there? \cite{lave_situated_1991}
		\item Legitimate peripheral membership \cite{davies_communities_2005}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\emph{Conversation analysis} \cite<c.f.>{sacks_simplest_1974}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Turn-taking, the \emph{floor}
		\item Repair
		\item Adjacency pairs
	\end{itemize}
	
	and \emph{CMDA} \cite<>{herring_computer-mediated_2004}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Structure
		\item Meaning
		\item Interaction
		\item Social behaviour
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Week 5B: SFL and CMC}
	
	We devoted special attention to SFL, as it's well-suited to CMC. Why?

	\begin{itemize}
	\item A functional theory/grammar for natural language in context
	\item Texts as constitutive of context
	\item Division of three kinds of meaning: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item interpersonal (via mood system), 
	\item ideational (via transitivity system), 
	\item textual (via theme/rheme, reference, conjunction)
\end{itemize}
	\item Genre as recognisable constellation of these three kinds of meanings
	\item Multimodal grammar
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Week 6}

	Situating CMC research \dots
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Exploratory and confirmatory
	\item Description and explanation
	\item Theory verification and generation
	\item Ontology, epistemology, methodology
	\item Positionality/reading position
	\end{itemize}

	Computer mediated discourse \cite{herring_computer-mediated_2001}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Competing defintions and models
		\item Operationalising discourse as a concept within CMC \cite{herring_discourse_2011}
		\item Big D and little d D/discourse \cite{gee_introduction_2013}
		\item Corpus-assisted discourse studies
		\item (Critical) discourse analysis
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Week 7}

	Week 7 was designed to help with Assignment 2. We looked at data collection and analysis:
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Qualitative/quantitative as a false, but useful binary
	\item Qualitative as necessitating multimodal data collection
	\item Crash course in basic scripting/programming for quantitative approaches
	\item \emph{Regular Expressions} for searching text data
	\item Corpus linguistics via \emph{AntConc}: \emph{keywords, clusters, concordance}
	\item Assignment 2: Learn these techniques in order to do CADS
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Week 8}

	It's complicated: multimodality and genre in CMC
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item CMC as inherently multimodal
	\item The use of grammar to analyse audio, video \dots
	\item Doing genre analysis in six easy steps \cite<see>{eggins_analysing:_2004}
	\item Unfortunately, what we want to do as applied linguists is complicated and difficult
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Week 9}

	Language learning and CMC
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item 2d to 4d language pedagogy
	\item Conceptualisation and problematisation of \emph{literacy}
	\item Gaming as a (complex) site of language acquisition
	\begin{itemize}
	\item are we learning English or WoW discourse?
	\end{itemize}
	\item Tutorial: comparing radically different kinds of language learning/teaching sites
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Week 10}

	Focussing our attention on CMC as a medium for the provision of health information and social support \dots
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item SFL as a way of separating support/information as mood/transitivity phenomena:
		\end{itemize}

	\begin{quotation}
	\enumsentence{``I would be \textbf{very} careful with just the Zoloft''}
	\end{quotation}
		
		\begin{itemize}
	\item A variety of stakeholders produce health-oriented content:

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Big industries
		\item Government
		\item User-maintained
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Health literacy (?)
	\item How could CMC research improve health outcomes?
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Week 11}
	
	Some of the bigger questions to bring us home: \emph{Big Data}, \emph{Control}, \emph{Ownership}, \emph{Choice}, \emph{The Good Life} \dots

	\begin{itemize}
	\item The allure and problematisation of Big Data and Big Data methods
	\item Media convergence:

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Devices
		\item Accounts
		\item Sites
		\item Providers

	\end{enumerate}
	\item Ultimately, is technology making life better?
		\item We must question technological liberalism and the \emph{``enhanced volition''} paradigm  \cite{dotson_technology_2012}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Week 12}

	Future directions for CMC as an industry, CMC as a research area, and for us \dots
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Assignment 3 questions?
	\item Visit if you've got any questions: extra office hours 27/10 and 28/10
	\item Submit a subject experience survey!
	\end{itemize}

	~\\~\\

	\dots and now, over to Gruba \dots !
