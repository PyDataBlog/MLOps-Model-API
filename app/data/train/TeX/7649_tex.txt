\paragraph{Asymmetric keys management} \hspace{0pt} \\
\small{Digital signatures (and shared secrets computation as we will see) require asymmetric cryptography: in the initialization wizard the application generates and stores in the preferences a key pair based on the elliptic curves; the reasons for this choice are performances and the smaller key length with respect to other keys (like RSA and DSA ones) at a fixed level of security. This makes the 140 characters (bytes) Android limit for a single sms no more a problem.}
