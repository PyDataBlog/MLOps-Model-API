One thing fighters are extremely powerful for is decoying enemy ships. Because they generally have very high-maneuver drives and commensurably high \skill{Pilot} Skills, they represent a great opportunity to drag an injured opponent back to the middle of the map where he can't escape (harrying!) or push him off the 4-line --- decoying him so far and fast away from his target that he can't return to the fight. Take advantage of the fact that your opponent probably won't target your little fighter when he can concentrate on killing your Corvette.
