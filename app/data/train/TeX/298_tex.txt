\section{Sensors}
\label{ss:aquagpusph:sensors}
%
In \NAME sensors are points where pressure and density fields will be measured. The method to add sensors into
the simulations has been described in the section \ref{sss:XML:Sensors}.\rc
%
Internally, the sensors are set as particles similar to the fluid ones, but with $imove = 0$ flag (fluid particles
have $imove > 0$ flag, and solid boundary elements $imove < 0$), and a null mass. The fields are interpolated in
the way described in section \ref{ss:sph_description}, where the discretized operators can be defined such that
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:sensors:interpolation}
\langle p \rangle_a & = & \frac{1}{\gamma_a} \sum\limits_{b \in \mathrm{Fluid}} \frac{p_b}{\rho_b} W_{ab} m_b
\vspace{0.3cm} \\
\langle \rho \rangle_a & = & \frac{1}{\gamma_a} \sum\limits_{b \in \mathrm{Fluid}} W_{ab} m_b
\end{eqnarray}
%
Sensors measured values are ever renormalized with the Shepard correction ($\gamma_a$ is not forced to be equal to
1), even though Shepard correction has switched off for the forces and density rate computation, but in order to
you can revert the correction $\gamma_a$ (formerly $sumW$) is included into the output sensors data file.\rc
%
The sensors output data file is printed in the execution folder (so enough permissions are expected) with the name
``\textbf{Sensors.dat}'', inside the file a header will be printed, where the fields included are documented, and
then several rows (one per output time instant) with the following data distributed in columns:
%
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Time instant $t \mbox{[s]}$.
	\item Sensor data columns (one per sensor).
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item X position  $X \mbox{[m]}$.
		\item Y position  $Y \mbox{[m]}$.
		\item Z position  $Z \mbox{[m]}$ (only for 3D cases).
		\item Pressure $p \mbox{[Pa]}$.
		\item Density $\rho \mbox{[kg/m}^3\mbox{]}$.
		\item Kernel completeness factor $\gamma$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
%
The fields are separated by tabulators. This file can be directly plot with gnuplot, or loaded easily with almost
data sheets.
