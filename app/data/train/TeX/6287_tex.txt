While [2] focus on a wireless sensor network to reduce the amount of wire to be distributed around the greenhouse, the focus in this paper will be on a low-cost implementation of a wired sensor network connected via the cheap Particle Photon wifi device. The main result of [2] 
is the minimization of wear and power consumption. While those properties are also appealing to a hobby greenhouse, they are less impactfull when the system is so small. Instead, the cost of buying such a system in the first place become a more important factor for a hobby greenhouse enthusiast.\\
