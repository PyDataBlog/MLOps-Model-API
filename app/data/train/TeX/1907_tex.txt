On each figure below, draw rectangles representing the corresponding 
Riemmann sums for the function $f$ on the interval $0 \leq t \leq 8$.
Calculate the (approximate) value of each sum.

Mick decides to run a marathon.  Mick's friend Mack rides behind him 
on a bicycle and clocks his pace every 15 minutes. Mick starts out 
strong, but after an hour and a half he is so exhausted that he has to 
stop.  The data Mack collected are summarized below:

\gotable{0}{1}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\hline
Time spent running (min) & 0  & 15 & 30 & 45 & 60 & 75 & 90 \\
\hline
Speed (mph)              & 12 & 11 & 10 & 10 & 8  &  7 & 0 \\
\hline
\hline
\stoptable

\npz 
Assuming that Mick's speed is never increasing, give upper and lower 
estimates for the distance Mick ran during the first half hour.
\vf

\npz
Give upper and lower estimates for the distance Mick ran in total 
during the entire hour and a half.
\vf

\npz
How often would Mack have needed to measure Mick's pace in order to 
find lower and upper estimates within 0.1 mile of the actual distance 
that he ran?
