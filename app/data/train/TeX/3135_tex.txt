The software described in this document is a new digital management system for car-sharing service that exclusively uses electrical cars. Nothing like this software already exists so the development of it need to start from zero. The software's main goal is the simplification of the car sharing service and the management of the reservation and the usage of electric cars. It can be applied to different small and big city and even in a large urban area and it's composed by a mobile application who permit the user to interact with the system and a web platform that explain to the users all the procedure to access to the service. 
There are two type of users:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Visitors: all the visitors have access to the login and registration page on the mobile application and will be also able to visit the information part of the website that include FAQ page and Home page
	\item Registered user: this user can, after the registration, reserve a car, drive it, park and charge in the predefined area and finally it can reports problems of the system.
\end{itemize}
After the login the user can look for nearest car and reserve it, he will than have 1 hour to get to the car open it and start the renting. At the end of his ride the user have to park the car in a safe area and if it's necessary/possible plug it into recharge.
Besides the specific user interfaces for users, the system offers also APIs to enable the development of additional services on top of the basic one.
