Quill was an optional component of HTCondor that maintained a mirror 
of HTCondor operational data
in a relational database.  The \Condor{quill} daemon updated
the data in the relation database, and the \Condor{dbmsd} daemon
maintained the database itself.

As of HTCondor version 8.7.7, Quill has been removed from the HTCondor source
code and is no longer available.
