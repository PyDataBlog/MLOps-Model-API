\begin{frame}{What are these questions about?}
	\begin{block}{}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item What exactly is it, what a neural network learns?
			\item How is it represented in the network?
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
	These two questions depend on the task the network is built to solve and the architecture chosen to do this.
	\begin{block}{}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Can we find and/or track it?
			\item What is going on inside a neural network at sampling time?
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
	To answer all these questions, common and new means where to be explored to do inspection on several neural \textit{language models}.
	
	\textit{More detailed questions are to follow when looking at the experiments}.
