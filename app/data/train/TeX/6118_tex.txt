\section{Third-party Libraries}
\label{sec:third-party}

\Frame\ makes use of a range of additional libraries both on server and on client side
(cf.~fig.~\ref{fig:third-party}). These are listed in the following without going into details.
However, the URLs provided give a good overview of the individual libraries.

\subsection{Server-side Libraries}
\label{sec:third-party-server}

\begin{description}
  \item[LESS]
    LESS is a dynamic stylesheet language that extends \gls{acr:css} by important features such as
    variables, mixins, nesting and functions. It forms a superset of \gls{acr:css} as every valid
    \gls{acr:css} file is also a valid LESS file. The language is integrated in the Play! framework
    and is used to define the majority of \frame's layout.\par
    \url{http://lesscss.org/}
  \item[Joda Time]
    Joda Time is an open-source Java library that provides a replacement for the core Java
    \texttt{date} and \texttt{time} classes. It addresses numerous flaws concerning the API design,
    implementation and performance. Joda Time is used for all date and time values in this work.\par
    \url{http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/}
  \item[Markdown \& Knockoff]
    Knockoff is a simple parser for the lightweight markup language Markdown. It converts the
    Markdown text to an object model which is subsequently translated to Scala's XHTML format. The
    combination of Markdown and Knockoff provides lightweight formatting for \frame's text
    attributes (cf.~sec.~\ref{sec:attributes}).\par
    \url{http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/}\\
    \url{http://tristanjuricek.com/knockoff/}
  \item[Typesafe Mailer]
    This simple emailer plug-in developed by Typesafe itself is used to send confirmation emails to
    \frame\ users. It is configured via the \texttt{smtp}-prefixed parameters in
    \texttt{conf/application.conf}.\par
    \url{https://github.com/typesafehub/play-plugins/tree/master/mailer}
\end{description}


\subsection{Client-side Libraries}
\label{sec:third-party-client}

\begin{description}
  \item[jQuery]
    jQuery is a free and open source JavaScript library built to simplify client-side scripting.
    Being the most popular JavaScript library in use,
    \footnote{cf.~\url{http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/javascript_library/all}
    (visited on 03/01/2013)} it has become a de facto standard in professional web development.
    jQuery features DOM traversal and manipulation, event handling and an AJAX abstraction
    layer.\par
    \url{http://jquery.com/}
  \item[jQuery UI]
    jQuery UI is built on top of jQuery and provides functionality for low-level interaction and
    animation. The library's set of high-level widgets (such as \textit{Menu}, \textit{Datepicker}
    or \textit{Dialog}) are not used, since Bootstrap offers excellent alternatives.\par
    \url{http://jqueryui.com/}
  \item[Bootstrap]
    Bootstrap is a very popular\footnote{Bootstrap is the most popular project on \textit{GitHub}:
    \url{https://github.com/popular/starred} (visited on 03/01/2013)} front-end toolkit developed
    by Twitter for developing web applications. It comprises a collection of design templates and
    \gls{acr:js} extensions for typography, forms, navigation and other \gls{acr:ui} components. 
    It is used for most of \frame's \gls{acr:ui} design.\par
    \url{http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/}\par
    To further improve \frame's front-end design the following tools and libraries are used:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Bootswatch:} \url{http://bootswatch.com/}
      \item \textbf{DatePicker:} \url{http://vitalets.github.com/bootstrap-datepicker/}
      \item \textbf{TimePicker:} \url{http://jdewit.github.com/bootstrap-timepicker/}
      \item \textbf{Select:} \url{http://silviomoreto.github.com/bootstrap-select/}
      \item \textbf{Switch:} \url{http://www.larentis.eu/switch/}
    \end{itemize}
  \item[CodeMirror]
    CodeMirror is a JavaScript editor component that provides a customizable code editor for web
    pages. It includes syntax highlighting and coloring for code fragments both inside and outside
    the editor component. The language-specific syntax is defined in a separate \gls{acr:js}
    file\footnote{\Frame's syntax is located in
    \texttt{public/third-party/codemirror/js/syntax.js}.}. CodeMirror is used to highlight \frame's
    predicate definitions (cf.~sec.~\ref{sec:query-lang}).\par
    \url{http://codemirror.net/}
  \item[D3.js]
    D3.js (aka \textbf{D}ata-\textbf{D}riven \textbf{D}ocuments) is a powerful visualization library
    written in JavaScript. The \textit{Collapsible Tree Layout} is used to visualize the evaluation
    of predicates (cf.~sec.~\ref{sec:query-lang-visualized}).\par
    \url{http://d3js.org/}
  \item[Select2]
    Since HTML select boxes offer highly limited possibilities concerning data management and
    styling, Select2 offers a jQuery-based replacement that supports searching, remote data sets and
    improved styling. These are necessary for the implementation of (client-sided) relations.\par
    \url{http://ivaynberg.github.com/select2/}
