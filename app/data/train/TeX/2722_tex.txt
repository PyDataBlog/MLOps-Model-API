@section  FloatArray Class
This class, which is a subclass of @code{NumberArray}, is used to
represent arbitrary shaped arrays of the C language @code{float} data
type in an efficient manner.  Although this class implements much of its
own functionality it is documented within the @code{NumberArray} and
@code{Array} classes because the interface is shared by all subclasses
of the @code{NumberArray} class.
