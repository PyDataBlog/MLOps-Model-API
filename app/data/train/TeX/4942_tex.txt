\section{DAB - Digital Audio Broadcasting}
    DAB in Transmission Mode I uses OFDM with $N = 1536$ Subchannels each with $B_c=1$ kHz bandwidth, all DQPSK-modulated.
	So, the symbol period is $T_{symbol} = \frac{1}{B_c} = 1$ ms and a symbol consists of $S = 2$bit $\cdot N = 3072$bit. 
	$M=76$ OFDM-symbols (and a null-symbol without data) are transmitted in 1 DAB-frame of $T_{frame}=96$ ms.
	Therefore the brutto-bit-rate can be calculated as $R = \frac{M\cdot 3072 \text{bit}}{T_{frame}}=2.432$Mbit/s.
