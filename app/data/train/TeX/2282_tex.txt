\title{The implementation of Semantic Web Service Framework for dynamic ontology alignment and extraction of generic data}
\studyline{Web Intelligence and Service Engineering}
\keywords{Master's Thesis, web, semantics, framework}

\abstract{%
  The thesis aims to implement a framework that allows to provide the semantic data in an easier and yet secure way as well as a central repository
  of information about applications using the framework, so that the communication with the application can be fully automated without
  any additional and unnecessary focus on the details of the structure of provided data by the developer aiming to create a client
  utilising the data.

  The framework

  \begin{itemize}
    \item should be easy to integrate with all popular java-related technologies (JEE, Spring, Maven, Gradle)
    \item should be fully configurable through annotations, so that the user doesn't have to create any additional XML files, that are often difficult to maintain
    \item should provide an easy way to create integration tests
    \item should provide multiple ways of introducing the ontology alignment. That includes the pre-implemented automated alignment based on string similarity despite differences in structure of the document,
            as well as possibility of manual specification of alignment and introducing custom automated alignment implementations. It also should be able to handle the storage of defined alignment either in SQL/NOSQL databases or files.
    \item should be able to provide the data in the client-requested format supporting JSON, XML, N3 and Turtle notations for generating the RDF documents.
    \item should cover automatic generation of queries to Sesame, so that the developer only has to define a java class that will represent the received data and doesn't have to write the queries himself (that also includes providing an easy way to integrate in-memory triple store for integration testing)

  \end{itemize}

  Apart from the framework, the project should include the central ontology repository.
  The repository should contain and provide the data about known applications using the framework, so that the search engines / developers
  can easily find links to semantic services provided by other applications.
