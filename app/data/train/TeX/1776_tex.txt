\title{Second derivative}

\begin{document}

\begin{abstract}
  The second derivative records how small changes affect the derivative.
\end{abstract}\maketitle

The derivative allowed us to find the best linear approximation to a
function at a point.  But how do these linear approximations change as
we move from point to nearby point?  That is exactly what the second
derivative is aiming for.
