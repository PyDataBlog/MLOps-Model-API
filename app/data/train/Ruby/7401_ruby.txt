# Largest Integer

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# largest_integer is a method that takes an array of integers as its input
# and returns the largest integer in the array
#
# +list_of_nums+ is an array of integers
# largest_integer(list_of_nums) should return the largest integer in the +list_of_nums+
#
# If +list_of_nums+ is empty the method should return nil

# Your Solution Below
def largest_integer(list_of_nums)
  largest = list_of_nums[0]
list_of_nums.each { |number|
    if number > largest
        largest = number
    end
  }

  return largest
end

# refactored solution
def largest_integer(list_of_nums)
  list_of_nums.sort.pop # trying out implicit returns
end
