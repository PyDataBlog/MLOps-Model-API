module Patterns

  # Monster -> Object
  #
  # The monster class. It delegates its calls to the monster type class.
  # This is an example of the Type Object pattern.
  # This is also an example of the concept of Object Composition over inheritance. The monster HAS a type attribute instead of inheriting one.
  # This allows us to decouple the monster from its type and stops inheritance from getting out of control in a system with many similar objects.
  class Monster

    # The MonsterType object of the Monster
    attr_accessor :monster_type

    # Initializes the monster class
    #
    # * +monster_type+ - The type of the monster that has a corresponding json file
    #
    # Examples
    #
    #   => orc = Monster.new('orc')
    def initialize(monster_type)
      @monster_type = MonsterType.new(monster_type)
    end

    # Performs a deep clone of the Monster Object by utilizing the MonsterType object
    #
    # Examples
    #
    #   => orc2 = orc.clone
    def deep_clone
      Monster.new(@monster_type)
    end

    # Delegates getting monster health to the monster_type
    #
    # Examples
    #
    #   => orc.health
    def health
      @monster_type.health
    end

    # Delegates getting monster attack to the monster_type
    #
    # Examples
    #
    #   => orc.attack
    def attack

    # Delegates getting monster range to the monster_type

    #
    # Examples
    #
    #   => orc.weaknesses

    # Gets this monster's prototype name if it has one and the string 'none' if it does not
    #
    # Examples
