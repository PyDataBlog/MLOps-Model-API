C         eos_calc calls ionize then fixes up the result consistent with
C         formation of hydrogen molecules.
C         the purpose of the two routines is to calculate ionization fractions
C         and weighted sums over those quantities.  the weighted sums are
C         ultimately used in an iterative way to calculate chemical potentials
C         according to some free energy model.  The appropriate difference in 
C         chemical potentials are then combined to form the dv quantities, 
C         the change in the equilibrium constant of an ion relative to the
C         un-ionized reference state and the free electron
C         dv = (partial F/partial nref - partial F/partial nion - ion*partial F/partial ne)/kT.
C         These dv values (held in an array) are required input to eos_calc.
C       
C         The free energy model:
C         it is the responsibility of the calling programme to 
C         fill in the dv quantities for the various ions in a manner
C         consistent with a particular free energy model.  It should be noted that
C         at the startup of the iteration, the free-energy terms corresponding
C         to pressure ionization and the Coulomb effect are approximated as
C         functions of only ne, so the dv array elements are quite similar
C         to each other.  (The electron exchange term is always just a function
C         of ne.) Later as more complicated models are used for the Coulomb
C         effect and pressure ionization, the dv array elements can become
C         more varied.
C         input quantitites:
C         nux, nuy, nuz are number/volume of maximum possible ionization
C         electrons (divided by rho*NA) for hydrogen, helium, and metals.
C         naux is the total number of auxiliary variables.
C         ifexcited > 0 means_use_excited states (must have Planck-Larkin or
C           ifpi = 3 or 4).
C            0 < ifexcited < 10 means_use_approximation to explicit summation
C           10 < ifexcited < 20 means_use_explicit summation
C           mod(ifexcited,10) = 1 means just apply to hydrogen (without molecules)
C             and helium.
C           mod(ifexcited,10) = 2 same as 1 + H2 and H2+.
C           mod(ifexcited,10) = 3 same as 2 + partially ionized metals.
C         ifsame_under = logical variable passed to ionize to control whether
C           to_use_the same underflow limits or recalculate them.
C           used for removing small discontinuities in eos when attempting
C           to obtain converged solution.
C         inv_ion(nions+2) maps ion index to contiguous ion index used in NR 
C           iteration dot products.
C         max_index is the maximum contiguous index used in NR iteration
C         partial_elements(n_partial_elements+2) index of elements treated as 
C           partially ionized consistent with ifelement.
C         ion_end(nelements) keeps track of largest ion index for each element.
C         ifionized = 0 means all elements treated as partially ionized
C         ifionized = 1 means trace metals fully ionized.
C         ifionized = 2 means all elements treated as fully ionized.
C         if_pteh controls whether pteh approximation used for Coulomb sums (1)
C           or whether_use_detailed Coulomb sum (0).
C         if_mc controls whether special approximation used for metal part
C           of Coulomb sum for the partially ionized metals.
C         if_mc = 1,_use_approximation
C         if_mc = 0, don't_use_approximation
C         ifreducedmass = 1 (use reduced mass in equilibrium constant)
C         ifreducedmass = 0 (use electron mass in equilibrium constant)
C         ifsame_abundances = 1, if call made with same abundances as previous
C           it is the responsibility of the calling programme to set
C           this flag where appropriate.  ifsame_abundances = 0 means
C           slower execution of ionize, but is completely safe against
C           abundance changes.
C         ifmtrace just to keep track of changes in ifelement.
C         iatomic_number(nelements), the atomic number of each element.
C         ifpi = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 if no, pteh, geff, mhd, or Saumon-style
C           pressure ionization
C         ifpl = 0, 1 if there is no or if there is planck-larkin
C         ifmodified > 0 or not affects ifpi_fit inside excitation_sum.
C         ifh2 non-zero implies h2 is included.
C         ifh2plus non-zero implies h2plus is included.
C         izlo is lowest core charge (1 for H, He, 2 for He+, etc.)
C           for all species.
C         izhi is highest core charge for all species.
C         bmin(izhi) is the minimum bion for all species with a given core charge.
C         nmin(izhi) is the minimum excited principal quantum number for
C           all species with a given core charge.
C         nmin_max(izhi) is the largest minimum excited principal
C           quantum number for all species with a given core charge.
C         nmin_species(nions+2) is the minimum excited principal quantum number
C           organized by species.
C         nmax is maximum principal quantum number included in sum
C           (to be compatible with opal which used nmax = 4 rather than infinity).
C           if(nmax > 300 000) then treated as infinity in qryd_approx.
C           otherwise nmax is meant to be used with qryd_calc only (i.e.,
C           case for mhd approximations not programmed).
C         eps(nelements) is the ratio of mass abundance/atomic mass
C         tl = log(t)
C         tc2 = c2/t
C         bi(nions_in+2) ionization potentials (cm**-1) in ion order:
C           h, he, he+, c, c+, etc.  H2 and H2+ are last two.
C         n.b. the code logic now demands there are iatomic_number ionized
C           states + 1 neutral state for each element.  Thus, the
C           ionization potentials must include all ions, not just
C           first ions (as for trace metals in old code).
C         h2diss, h2 dissociation energy
C         plop(nions+2), plopt, plopt2 planck-larkin occupation probabilities
C           + derivatives.
C         r_ion3(nions+2), *cube of the*
C           effective radii (in ion order but going from neutral
C           to next to bare ion for each species) of MDH interaction between
C           all but bare nucleii species and ionized species.  last 2 are
C           H2 and H2+ (used externally)
C         r_neutral(nelements+2) effective radii for MDH neutral-neutral 
C           interactions.  Last two (used externally) are for for H2 and H2+ (the only ionic
C           species in the MHD model with a non-zero hard-sphere radius).
C         ifelement(nelements) = 1 if element treated as partially ionized
C         (depending on abundance, and trace metal treatment), 0 if
C         element treated as fully ionized or has no abundance.
C         dvzero(nelements) is a zero point shift that is added to dv in ionize,
C           but which is zero for hydrogen.
C         dv(nions) change in equilibrium constant (explained above)
C         dvf(nions) = d dv/d ln f
C         dvt(nions) = d dv/d ln t
C         nion(nions), charge on ion in ion order (must be same order as bi)
C           e.g., for H+, He+, He++, etc.
C         re, ref, ret: fermi-dirac integral and derivatives
C         output quantities:
C         ne, nef, net is nu(e) = n(positive ions)/(Navogadro*rho) and its 
C           derivatives calculated from all elements.
C         sion, sionf, siont is the ideal entropy/R per unit mass and its 
C           derivatives with respect to lnf and ln t.
C         n.b. if ionized, then the contribution from all elements is
C         calculated in ionize.f.  If partially ionized, then ionize separates
C         the hydrogen from the rest of the components.  If molecular, the
C         hydrogen component from ionize is completely ignored, and
C         recalculated in this routine.
C         n.b.  sion returns a component of entropy/R per unit mass,
C         sion = the sum over all non-electron species of
C         -nu_i*[-5/2 - 3/2 ln T + ln(alpha) - ln Na 
C           + ln (n_i/[A_i^{3/2} Q_i]) - dln Q_i/d ln T],
C         where nu_i = n_i/(Na rho), Na is the Avogadro number,
C         A_i is the atomic weight,
C         alpha =  (2 pi k/[Na h^2])^(-3/2) Na
C         (see documentation of alpha^2 in constants.h), and
C         Q_i is the internal ideal partition function
C         of the non-Rydberg states.  (Currently, we calculate this
C         partition function by the statistical weights of the ground states
C         of helium and the combined lower states (roughly
C         approximated) of each of the metals.
C         helium is subsequently corrected for detailed excitation
C         of the non-Rydberg states, and this crude approximation for the metals
C         is not currently corrected.  Thus, in all *current* monatomic
C         cases ln Q_i is a constant, and dln Q_i/d ln T is zero, but this
C         will change for the metals eventually.
C         currently, hydrogen is treated exactly for all cases (full ionization,
C         partial ionization, partial molecular formation).
C         From the equilibrium constant approach and the monatomic species
C         treated in this subroutine (molecules treated outside) we have
C         -nu_i ln (n_i/[A_i^{3/2} Q_i]) =
C         -nu_i * [ln (n_neutral/[A_neutral^{3/2} Q_neutral) +
C         (- chi_i/kT + dv_i)]
C         if we sum this term over all species
C         of an element without molecules we obtain
C         s_element = - eps * ln (eps*n_neutral/sum(n))
C         - eps ln (alpha/(A_neutral^{3/2} Q_neutral)) -
C         - sum over all species of the element of nu_i*(-chi/kT + dv(i))
C         where we have ignored the term
C         eps * (-5/2 - 3/2 ln T + ln rho)
C         (taking into account the first 4 terms above).
C         If hydrogen molecules are included,
C         the result is the same except for the addition of the
C         d ln Q_i/d ln T term (which will also appear for the metals eventually)
C         and the 5/2 factor is multiplied by sum over all species which is
C         corrected to eps by subtracting 5/2 (nu(H2) + nu(H2+)) from sion below.
C         note a final correction of the s zero point occurs
C         in awieos_detailed.f which puts back the ignored terms for both
C         the case of molecules and no molecules.
C         uion is the ideal internal energy (cm^-1 per unit mass divided by
C           avogadro).
C         h, hf, ht is n(H+) and its derivatives with respect to ln f and ln t.
C         hd, hdf, hdt is n(He+) and its derivatives with respect to 
C           ln f and ln t.

C           non-zero radii according to the MHD model) and
C           weight is r_neutral^{iextrasum-1}.
C           for iextrasum = nextrasum-1, sum is over all ionized species including
C           bare nucleii, but excluding free electrons, weight is Z^1.5.
C           for iextrasum = nextrasum, sum is over all species excluding bare nucleii

C      Setting fbar to a large negative number essentially disables the

C      of magnitude of unity.

C      epsilon is a delta f expected from roundoff error to add
C      some robustness in the presence of round-off error.  df_criterion
C      is the function value convergence parameter for the bfgs iteration.
C      gradient_criterion is the maximum absolute value of all gradient
C      components before can exit from bfgs iteration.
C      these three parameters are in absolute units of func, but
C      func = free/(full_sum0*RT) is expected to stay within a few orders
C      of magnitude of unity.
C      These values may be fairly critical so some experimentation may be
