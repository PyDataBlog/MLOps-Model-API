//! Resource data implementations.
//!
//! This module will eventually contain implementations for the record data
//! for all defined resource record types.
//!
//! The types are named identically to the [`Rtype`] variant they implement.
//! They are grouped into submodules for the RFCs they are defined in. All
//! types are also re-exported at the top level here. Ie., for the AAAA
//! record type, you can simple `use domain::rdata::Aaaa` instead of
//! `use domain::rdata::rfc3596::Aaaa` which nobody could possibly remember.
//! There are, however, some helper data types defined here and there which
//! are not re-exported to keep things somewhat tidy.
//!
//! See the [`Rtype`] enum for the complete set of record types and,
//! consequently, those types that are still missing.
//!
