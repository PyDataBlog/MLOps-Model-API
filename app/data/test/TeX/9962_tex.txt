		{Sept 2016}
		{Genetic Analysis}
		{Machine Learning algorithms, such as SVM, Logistic Regression, DBGR, etc. were applied to analyse genetic data to find out one SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) or more which is/are highly likely to cause some diseases. In this contest, genetic datasets of patients was provided, which consist of 1000 samples having 9445 features. In pre-processing stage, it was necessary to correct or delete incomplete samples, and encode all samples. And in the modelling stage, we considered three machine learning methods, such as logistic regression, svm and gbdt, which were trained with respective training parameters. In the final stage, validate these models using 5-fold CV, calculate prediction accuracies, and pick out common features with top N possibilities.}
