\section{Installation requirements}
\label{sec:installation}
Weviation is written in Python version 2.7.x.x, which can be downloaded from \url{https://www.python.org/downloads/}.
In order to run the GUI, wxPython is required, and can be downloaded from \url{http://www.wxpython.org/download.php}. To check if wxPython is installed correctly type,\\
\indent \texttt{import wx}\\
\noindent in the Python interactive shell or when using a terminal, first type\\
\indent \texttt{python}\\
\noindent to start Python and then \texttt{import wx}.
If no import error shows up, then wxPython is installed correctly.

The following libraries are also needed: matplotlib (download from \url{http://matplotlib.org/downloads.html}) and numpy (download from \url{http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html}). Again, to first if the libraries are already installed or successfully installed type,\\
\indent \texttt{import matplotlib}\\
\noindent in the Python interactive shell or when using a terminal, first type\\
\indent \texttt{python}\\
\noindent to start Python and then \texttt{import matplotlib}.
If no import error shows up, then matplotlib is installed correctly. The same should be done for numpy.
