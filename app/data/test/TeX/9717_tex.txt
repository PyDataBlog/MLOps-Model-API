\textbf{Thesis}: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Two central questions dominate the filibuster-reform debate:
\begin{itemize}
\item Can Congress only make massive changes to regulation in a small window during its' early days?
\item Can the Filibuster be changed by a simple majority vote?
\item Answer: no and yes -- a simple majority vote can easily end the Filibuster.
\end{itemize}
\item New York Times et. al: a Congress's first days are important because \textit{only then} can a simple majority modify the filibuster.
\begin{itemize}
\item Right about simple majority, wrong about small window opening.
\item Confusion root cause $\to$ House vs. Senate. The entire House gets re-elected every other year, whereas in Senate most Senators in any given election cycle keep their seats.
\item That said, for the House, its first days are important because they decide the internal House regulations by which laws get passed.
\item The Senate, on the other hand, doesn't need to make new procedures every election. Filibuster is carried along into the next Senate (along with old leaders), and both can be eliminated via simple majority vote at any time. 
\end{itemize}
\item Paradox: End a Filibuster (which contains a 60 vote minimum bar for laws) wtih 51 votes. Sounds like a Catch-22. Except not really.
\begin{itemize}
\item John Locke, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, et. al: majority rule was a core principle for any legislative assembly, and more so for any natural body of men.
\item Likewise, this notion of default majority rule is integrated into the Constitution, where all decision made by the federal government would be decided by simple majority. (unless an exception was written into the Constitution)
\item  Similarly, the Consitution has each House pass simple majorities for laws, and harder super majorities for special cases. (e.g. impeachment for the House, international treaties/affairs for the Senate)
\item Similar rules exist for excluding properly elected and elibible Congress-members (supermajority) versus excluding improperly elected/constitutionally ineligible Congress-members. (a regular simple mmajority)
\end{itemize}
\item Point of Consideration: Why did the Framers specifically specify Congress would constitute quorums? Answer: No previous default rule existed.
\begin{itemize}
\item The Senate similarly operates off a simple majority, and existed as such through the 1830s.
\item Filibustering initially developed in the 19th Century (albeit with a Senate majority), but filibustering in the modern sense emerged in the 1970s \~ 2000s, nanely the 60 vote rule.
\item MAny times Congress has considered getting rid of the 50 Rule provision, but it hasn't actually done so. 
\end{itemize}
\item Now What?
\begin{itemize}
\item The Senate requires specific voting rules for internal proceedings -- that is, a rule for how to vote on how to vote. 
\item Surprisingly, no instance of a formal supermajority requirement exists. (Not even with the Filibuster) 
\item Rule 22: ``debate on its own appeal cannot be ended this way" -- in other words, to repeal Rule 22, fair and equal opportunities to debate it are required.
\item But the Filibuster's usage as a method to obstruct debate is one whose role should be reconsidered by senators, and decided on through simple majority. 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
