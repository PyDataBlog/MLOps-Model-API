\abstract{Here Morten the Roman-Viking (who has never admitted his Norse roots) goes finally berserk in a classical Norse way and and Bira, clad in his befitting apologetic suit,  presents himself as the true messiah of EFT and shouts stand up all ye infidels and hail the master. Halleluja and amen. Maria Paola is left speechless and runs for shelter somewhere in lovely Frascati (we envy her).}
