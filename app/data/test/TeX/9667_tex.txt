Most neural networks are unable to handle the amount of data contained in an image.
For example an image with a resolution of 3264x2448 (8 Megapixels) would result in almost 24 million inputs, as each pixel is split into its red, green and blue parts.

Another challenge is the detection of so called "features" across an image. Traditional neural networks only detect a feature at a specific location in the image.
This is a big issue in image recognition, as you almost always want the entire image to be handled equally.
A self-driving car should recognize a stop sign, regardless of its position in the image.
