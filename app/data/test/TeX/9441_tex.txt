\section{Splitting Types for the Verlinde Bundles}

Now that we have a presentation for $V_k$, we will try to exploit it as much as possible to extract information about the splitting types that can occur for the restriction of $V_k$ to lines. We will see that the $V_k$ are not uniform and that the expected generic splitting type is attained for $d\leq k < 2d$. We also demonstrate that the number of nonzero entries of the splitting type of $V_k|_T$ is known if we know two points in $T$.
