		<h4>Gmail</h4>
		<span>
			<p>This page solves the problem of users receiving their email in a convenient way. The first visual challenge is presenting all the information without a cluttered, offputting environment. The second challenge is going beyond this to make the site a friendly place where customers want to spend more time. I think this is achieved in large part by the customizability: On the left I see the folders I made. And my background is a fun one that I chose.</p>

		<h4>Evernote</h4>
		<span>
			<p>Evernote is solving the problem of having disaggregated, disorganized notes. One visual challenge is organizing a lot of content in a display that will at all times keet the user aware of where they are on the site. Evernote addresses this well with the double navigation bar to the left of the screen.</p>

		<h4>Nytimes.com</h4>
		<span>
			<p>This site solves the problem of of providing news to users in an appealing way that makes them want to stay on the site. The biggest design challenge I see is finding a conpromise between clear organization and visually appealing layout. Nytimes strikes this balance well. On the homepage, and all other pages, a user can access a list of newspaper sections. But the main page also features a traditional newspaper layout of various articles, which is appealing to the eye.</p>
