title: Our Lamp

<p> At this stage we have decided to keep the stucture of the lamp simplistic and modern looking as possible.</p>
<p> Having too many parts makes the lamp look more messy instead of a clean look.</p>
<p>Though we like the panel and iris structures, timewise we would like to focus on one aspect and make it look and work exactly how we want.</p>
