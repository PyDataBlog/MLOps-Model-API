OpenDesk is a global platform for local making. You can use it to download,
make and buy furniture for your work space.

OpenDesk has a global network of makers and a collection of furniture by a range
of international designers. Because that furniture is designed for digital
fabrication, it can be downloaded as a digital file and made locally â€” on demand,
anywhere in the world.
