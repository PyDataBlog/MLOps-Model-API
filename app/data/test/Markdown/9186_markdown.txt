1. Europeana has the objective to provide access to Europe’s cultural and scientific heritage;

2. Europeana shall publish all Metadata, including the Metadata provided by the Data Partner prior to the Effective Date, under the terms of the CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication and is hereby authorised by the Data Partner to do so. The Data Partner recognises that it hereby waives – to the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law – all Intellectual Property Rights in the Metadata it has provided and will provide to Europeana. If – according to the applicable law – such waivers are not legally binding in particular territories the 'Public License Fallback' in section 3 of the CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication will apply, and the Metadata provided by the Data Partner is licensed non-exclusively, unconditionally, free-of-charge for all types of use and for all territories to the public. 
3. In as far as the Data Partner has provided or will provide Europeana with Metadata that it has aggregated from Third Parties or that otherwise originate from Third Parties, the Data Partner shall ensure that these Third Parties have authorised the Data Partner to authorise Europeana in accordance with paragraph 2 of this article.
4. When Europeana publishes Metadata that can be (in whole or in part) attributed to the Data Partner, Europeana is obliged to give attribution to the Data Partner and to the party or parties referred to by the Data Partner through the ``edm:dataProvider`` field (or its equivalent in a later version) of the Metadata Specification.
5. In the event that Europeana publishes a translation or transcription based on Metadata provided by the Data Partner, Europeana shall identify the translation or transcription as such.

Notwithstanding paragraphs 2 and 3 of this article, Europeana is entitled to allow use of the Thumbnails by visitors of Europeana.eu and Third Parties in accordance with terms specified by the Data Partner in the ``edm:rights`` field (or its equivalent in a later version) of the Metadata Specifications.   
2. Europeana is entitled to store and publish on Europeana.eu all Thumbnails provided by the Data Partner, though only in combination with the Metadata that pertain to the same Content.
3. In as far as the Data Partner is the proprietor of Intellectual Property Rights to the Thumbnails it provides to Europeana, the Data Partner hereby grants Europeana a licence to use these rights in accordance with this article, without affecting any moral rights that it may have in these Thumbnails. 
4. In as far as the Data Partner has provided or will provide Europeana with Thumbnails that it has aggregated from Third Parties or that otherwise originate from Third Parties, the Data Partner ensures that these Third Parties have authorised the Data Partner to enable Europeana to perform paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article.

## Article 5 Use of Digital Objects

1. If the Metadata provided to Europeana contains direct links to the associated Digital Objects, Europeana will provide visitors of Europeana.eu the ability to view such Digital Objects without leaving Europeana.eu.
2. Other than in situations as described in paragraph 3 of this article, Europeana will not store copies of the Digital Objects.

3. In the event that a Data Partner or a Third Party notifies Europeana that it is of the opinion that performance by Europeana of articles 3 and 4 constitutes an unlawful act towards any party, Europeana shall within five (5) working days decide whether it considers the notice (i) void of grounds, (ii) readily awardable or (iii) subject to debate, and Europeana shall perform the following:
	1. In the event that Europeana considers the notice void of grounds, it shall inform the notifying party accordingly.
	2. In the event that Europeana considers the notice readily awardable, it shall take all required measures to end the unlawful state. Europeana shall inform both the notifying party and the Data Partner of its decision and the measures undertaken.
	3. In the event that Europeana considers the notice subject to debate, it shall inform the notifying party of this decision and allow the Data Partner to provide its views on the opinion within five (5) working days from the date that Europeana has forwarded the opinion to the Data Partner. Upon receipt of the views of the Data Partner, Europeana shall decide within five (5) working days whether measures are required to end an unlawful state. Europeana may decide to request the notifying party and, subsequently, the Data Partner, to provide further views.
4. Both parties shall hold the other party free and harmless of any action, recourse or claims made by any Third Party due to the non-observance of its obligations under this agreement.

## Article 7 Termination

## Article 9 Miscellaneous

If the modifications are not accepted by the Data Partner in writing within the allowed period, the modifications are presumed to have been rejected. If the proposed modifications are rejected by the Data Partner, Europeana has the right to terminate this agreement against 31 December of any year, with a one (1) month notice.
