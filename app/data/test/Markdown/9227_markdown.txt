# daisyworld [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ogruen/daisyworld.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ogruen/daisyworld)
Implementation of daisyworld by Lovelock and Watson and a spatial grid based approach using C++.

### Compile and run
Clone the repo, you will find a directory code/cc with a Makefile. A gcc compiler is needed. I am using Linux, maybe Windows needs more configuration. I 
suggest Cygwin to get it running.

```
cd code/cc
make
./Simulation
```

The simulation writes data to folder /data/raw/.
The data format is tab-separated values so it should be easy to plot it with your favourite plotting tool.
I used Gnuplot, Version 4.4 patchlevel 3. You can find the Gnuplot script in folder /plots/plotit.gp. Run it with
the command load './plotit.gp' in gnuplot. It creates plots and saves the images to /plots/exploratory/

The main function found in Simulation.cc is fairly simple. It uses one of three implemented methods:

- SimpleGrowth: Simple cellular automata model. If a cell has daisies in its neighbourhood, a daisy is grown at cell.
- DaisyworldClassic: vanilla daisyworld using the formulas and descriptions found in the references below (data exported to data_rule2.txt)
- DaisyworldCA: Grid based daisyworld. Daisies now cover a grid and spread to neighbour cells (data exported to data_rule3.txt)

For a SDL visualization of the environment growing daisies over time, check out branch daisyworld_sdl. 
You'll need SDL2 to compile it as well as SDL2_image and SDL2_gfxPrimitives. In case your distribution doesn't provide 
gfxPrimitives, you can find it here: http://cms.ferzkopp.net/index.php/software/13-sdl-gfx

Feel free to send me suggestions, ideas, bugs via pull request or email.
