I have been sloppy keeping this up to date. I managed to post quite a
few ski pics here and mentionned my bike, but I have failed to post
any pictures of my bike in cool places.

This is a shame, because my bike has managed to go to some pretty cool
places this spring. Since most of these adventures were documented by
my Android phone, I know the date of each adventure. This weekend, I
am going to go through these pics and post a few back-dated posts to
document some of my recent adventures.

Update: 2014-06-24: I'm done. I managed to add a number of things I
had wanted to put up here. In the future, I'll try to not get
behind. I think I need a current events category too. I'll work on
that.
