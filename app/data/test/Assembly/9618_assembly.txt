;just a simple loop to set generate the first 20 Fibonacci sequence numbers
;and put them in memory addresses 0-19

        SET A, 1        ;a and b are the first numbers of Fibo
        SET B, 1
        SET X, 0x00     ;where in memory to put them all
        SET [X], A
        ADD X, 1
        SET [X], B
        ADD X, 1        ;first 2 are now done
        SET I, 18
:loop   SET C, A
        ADD C, B        ; the next fibo number
        SET [X], C
        SET A, B
        SET B, C
        SUB I, 1
        IFN I, 0
        SET PC, loop
