\chapter*{Abstract}
This report documents my internship at GeoCat BV from November 2012
untill May 2013 and is part of the curriculum for the Master of Science
programme Geo-Information Science at the Wageningen University. The
report focuses on three different project I contributed to during my
internship and my experiences I gained while working on these projects. 
Also a small study is presented on developments in the domain of \ac{SWE}. The goal of this study is to provide an overview of the current state of affairs and provide a future perspective of a \ac{SWE} based Sensor Web.
