\subsection{Projects}


\vspace{5pt}

\begin{itemize}
\vspace{3pt}

\item{ \textbf{GitHub | \href{https://github.com/hadisinaee/pz}{Prettier Zap}}: \textit{'Beautify And Query Zap Logger Outputs'}
\vspace{3pt}

\small{Zap is a high-performance logger written by uber. The default output behavior doesn’t support a log beautifier and all the logs are written in JSON raw. Therefore, there is no way to get a particular log. Prettier-Zap makes the output of zap logger more beautiful and allows the developer to query, based on different log fields even user-defined ones.}
}

\vspace{6pt}

\item{ \textbf{GitHub | \href{https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer}{System Design Premiere Translation}}: \textit{'Persian Translation of System Design Premier'}
\vspace{3pt}

\small{System Design Premier is a repository for system designing. I translated it into Persian. It is still an active pull request.}
}

\vspace{6pt}

\item{ \textbf{HodHod | Instant Messaging Platform}: \textit{'An instant messaging platform for sending data in real-time'}

\vspace{3pt}

\small{The encryption algorithm is derived from \textbf{MTProto} protocol with some modifications for security reasons. The architecture is based on the micro-services with 3 layers. We were going to use \textbf{Cassandra}, \textbf{MongoDB}, and \textbf{Redis} as our main storages. The micro service communications were over \textbf{gRPC}. The packaging would be with \textbf{dockers} and the orchestration was done with \textbf{Kubernetes}. In order to instrument our services, we used \textbf{OpenTracing} standard. All services were going to be written in \textbf{Golang}. I was responsible for the project design and delivery.}
}
