We thought at the initial report to work using a CVS for our code that we'll keep using as provides extended control and integrity over our code and iterative development as provides features in short periods of time, but taking an adequate time to design, implement and test (from now on transactions for the payment channels) and reducing the iteration times to one week or less strictly to see results soon. What we've learned is that design (or transaction and script model or creation in these cases) is really important as if a mistake is made in that stage and then everything gets implemented, we'll realize the mistake while testing, having to change the design and losing much of the time of a work that in most cases won't be profitable. Therefore in these further iterations of the software development we'll increase time in design and testing and try to reduce it in implementation as the prior objective is to create operational transactions that create a payment channel.

\section{Conclusions}
We'll follow the same methodologies as have been useful to keep and maintain a rhythm to be on time in most of the time of the project. We'll just invest a few more time in design stage to prevent design errors to be discovered on the test phase and losing implementation work time, while also adding more time to the test phase as implementing scripts is not easy as far as we have seen. Also reducing the iterations to one week or less will try to provide more features in less time. We'll check in next report how this methodology has worked.
