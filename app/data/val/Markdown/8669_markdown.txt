# Visual Studio Team Services queries

A webpage where you can run pre-defined vsts querys that are too complex to make in the [vsts query editor](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/work/track/using-queries).

## Queries
So far there is only one query in the project.

### Pullrequests and related work items
Use this query to get a list of completed pull requests and their associated work-items.

You can use this query as a poor manâ€™s release management tool:

Set your master branch to protected and set it to "block pull requests unless they have a linked work item".

Let your continuous integration system note the commit idwhen you make a release build or incorporate the commit id in the version number of the build.

Use this query to find the completed pull requests since the last time you made a release build and get a list of the associated work-items.

Then you can use the vsts query editor to create a release mail, change the state or add a tag on the associated work-items.
