AssertJ-DB - Assertions for database
==========

AssertJ-DB provides some assertions to test values in a database.

The goal is to be an alternative to DBUnit for people who don't like to write XML.

You can find all the informations you need in the [documentation](http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/assertj-db.html).
