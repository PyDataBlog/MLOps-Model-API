title: You're up and running!

Hello Internet!  This blog is up, running, and ready to cover development topics, testing, and my personal favorite - soft skills improvement.  

I have to say that I love forking a repo, editing some files, and having a blog up and running quickly without needing a large and frequently vulnerable CMS.  Thank you @barryclark and github for being awesome!
