title: Feminism and gender equality
bestof: true

I've been thinking a lot over the last few months about equality, specifically gender equality. There's been so much talk about it in the tech-sphere that's it's been difficult to avoid. I've been thinking about how close we are to gender equality and how I can help move us toward that goal, but also about what to call it.

Over the last year or so I've been asked a number of times if I'm a feminist (to which I normally respond "no"), or even had people go so far as to tell me I am one. 'Feminist' is not a label I'd willingly give myself, and increasingly it's not one I'll willingly accept being applied to me. Those that apply the feminist label to me do so because a subset of my beliefs, specifically those surrounding gender equality, are the same as their understanding of what feminism is. I believe that broadly speaking gender should not be a differentiator in most situations. That doesn't make me a feminist. All it does, if anything, is provide evidence that I'm a decent human being.

I don't think that assigning labels like feminist to people is a particularly nice thing to do, and I certainly don't think it's helpful. I could just as easily pick out a subset of someone's beliefs and call them a Christian as a result, not something that most people would take kindly to. Labelling people aside, I'd like to talk about why I don't self identify as a feminist.

Contrary to the term 'gender equality', 'feminist' is ambiguous, unbounded and gendered. If you were to go and ask a large number of people what they think feminism is I suspect you'll get a wide range of answers. Some might even contradict each other, which isn't surprising given the broadness of the term.

'Gender equality' is specific and unambiguous in it's meaning and interpretation, and it's bounded to one problem in society. It's not a term that can grow or change over time, gender equality is all genders being equal in society, with equal opportunity for change given to the specific problems of any gender, without focus on one.

Feminism, historically, has been a movement by women, for women. It's a movement born of a time of horrific inequality, a time where basic rights were denied to half the population for no reason. Feminism started the conversation about gender equality, and for that I will be eternally grateful. We would not be where we are today without feminism. But I don't believe that a movement dominated by a single gender can keep us on the right path. A movement of female voices is unlikely to speak for the issues men face, such as suicide rates, depression and the cultural pressure to be the main provider in a household. Feminism has caused the socially acceptable roles of women to change and broaden drastically, but the roles of men have barely changed.

I think it's time to move on from feminism, and go forwards with a new idea and a new movement that's more accessible to everyone. Having a movement with the root word "female" is like hanging a massive sign saying "men not welcome". And that's fine. If you want a dude-free place to talk about women's issues go for it, but it seems unreasonable to me to expect that to stand for equal rights for all genders if half the population doesn't even have a voice.
