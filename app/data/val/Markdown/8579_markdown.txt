So the first week has finally concluded. It was a week of balancing. Balancing between my exams and my  project. I promised myself that I would focus on my exams and start my work from 7th . I ended up breaking the promise I made to myself.

So the summary of the week is that I have Implemented Code for border Import. It hasn't been merged into the master not because the code wasn't working or I was just too lazy to do the work but because I had done some coding style mistakes like sandwitching operator between 2 tokens (eg: if (a==b)) . Multipple rejections by the code-reviewer to merge my code has left me very happy. Im a happy because I learnt something which I would have never learnt by myself. These are the things that neither competitive programming teaches you nor your proffessor.

Writing Code is like writing an essay. You have to be very clear with your thought and convey your thought with that much clarity to the reader. There were times when choosing a variable name seemed difficult task. I dedicated alot of time to things like these (which otherwise seem trivial) but would help someone else understand the source code. 

I still have some exams left So would continue with the rest of the work from 7th June. I would go for number formatting and cell protection in the coming week. Thanks for reading. Have a nice day(or night).
