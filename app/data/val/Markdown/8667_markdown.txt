Picked up Blue from airport parking, everything started fine! Walked around Piedmont Park for awhile, then met up with Meredith again later in the day for climbing at the _huge_ Stone Summit climbing gym, amazing french food at a restaurant owned by a Vietnamese lady, and watching Singin' in the Rain at a special 65th anniversary showing.
