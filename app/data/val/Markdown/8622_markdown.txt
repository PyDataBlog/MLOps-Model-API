System fonts bug demo
---

This sample project demonstrates and issue affecting iOS 8.2 and newer: when attempting to use `-[UIFont fontWithSize:]` method on a system font object returned from `+[UIFont systemFontOfSize:weight:]`, the returned font will have a different font name (and thus, weight) than the original font. This issue does not affect fonts with `UIFontWeightRegular` and `UIFontWeightMedium` weights and fonts returned from other system font static methods.

This project also demonstrates a workaround for this issue: instead of using `-[UIFont fontWithSize:]`, one can do something like this:

```
UIFont *newFont = [UIFont fontWithDescriptor:font.fontDescriptor size:newSize];
```

where `font` is the original font object and `newSize` is the required new font size. This technique seems to return correct new fonts regardless of where the original font originates from.
