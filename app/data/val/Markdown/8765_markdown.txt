# Banker
React powered tiny "personal accounting" app


### motivation
I'm doing this app for a couple reasons, which are
- my personal usage (if it works, why not use it :)
- my react training; the app is developped using React, "react-router", and the Redux pattern.
it might also use things like SASS or Aphrodite in the future, as well as [LeafDB](https://github.com/NicolasThebaud/leafDB)
