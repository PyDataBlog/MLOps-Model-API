**Lesson 10**

In today's lesson, we had a great time! We watched our teacher code the letter 'A’ and then we had a go at coding it ourselves. We all had to go back to our places and spend around twenty minutes trying to code the letter ‘A’. After we had done this, we had to create a three letter word with our initials and the letter ‘A’. I coded the word ‘AND’ because my initials are ‘ND’. However, it wasn’t just that easy. We also had to then put them on a straight line and make it neat. To start off with, my word looked like this:

But after a bit of coding, I was able to make my word legible and this was my final outcome:
