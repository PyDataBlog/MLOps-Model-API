<p/>In its current form, Miller handles ASCII data by design. This means it
also handles UTF-8, albeit mostly by accident. (I have no plans to support
UTF-16 or ISO-8859-1 is.) Tabular output formats (pprint and xtab) are handled correctly.
I&rsquo;m not aware of any UTF8-related bugs, but please file an issue at <a
href="https://github.com/johnkerl/miller">https://github.com/johnkerl/miller</a>
if you encounter one.
