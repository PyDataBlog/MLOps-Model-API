		<h1>Vevida Datagrid</h1>

		<p>
			The Vevida Datagrid is a custom component built for <a href="http://aurelia.io/">Aurelia</a>,
			used to display large amounts of data in a usable, clear way.
		</p>
		<p>
			This project is a demonstration and proof-of-concept. We want to use it
			to gauge interest in this datagrid. If you think this datagrid is
			something you might want to use, or contribute to, <a href="https://github.com/Vevida/datagrid-demo/issues/1">let us know</a>.
