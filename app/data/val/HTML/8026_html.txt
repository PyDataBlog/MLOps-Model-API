The concrete classes implementing data gathering for operating systems
with massive delegation to a native library, such as Windows and Linux. Do
<b>not</b> reference classes in this package. Use 
{@link de.uni_hildesheim.sse.system.GathererFactory} instead. The name of this
package is chosen in order to reduce the size of the native library.
