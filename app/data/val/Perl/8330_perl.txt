=head1 SYNOPSIS

Sample to inspect a conatainer, for mor posibilities see at the Docker API
documentation L<https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.25/>

    use App::Docker::Client;

    my $client = App::Docker::Client->new();

    my $hash_ref = $client->get('/containers/<container_id>/json');

Create a new container:
    
    $client->post('/containers/create', {}, {
        Name      => 'container_name',
        Tty       => 1,
        OpenStdin => 1,
        Image     => 'perl',
    });

For a remote authority engine use it like that:

    use App::Docker::Client;
    
    my %hash = ( authority => '0.0.0.0:5435' );

    my $client = App::Docker::Client->new( %hash );

    my $hash_ref = $client->get('/containers/<container_id>/json');

To follow logs

    *STDOUT->autoflush(1);

    my $cv = $client->attach(
        '/containers/<container_id>/attach',
        { stream => 1, logs => 1, stdin => 1, stderr => 1, stdout => 1, tail => 50 },
        \*STDIN,
        \*STDOUT
    );
    $cv->recv;
